I'm a certified agile team coach and project manager with 13 years of experience in IT. Also, I'm a founder and board director of a volunteer organisation. My biggest passion is people and their interactions, which makes me believe that mastering people skills is the way to survive in today's world. 
I prefer a challenging but supportive approach when leading projects and teams. I tend to create an environment where colleagues can leverage their personal and professional potential.
