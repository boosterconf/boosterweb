Developer @ Storebrand. I like pair programming and delivering value to customers. Care about testing, readable code and frequent deliveries. And naming things. Also people and interactions more than processes and tools. And agile.
Involved in communities for knowledge sharing; javaBin, Stavanger Agile Meetup and the new software conference HelloStavanger.no
