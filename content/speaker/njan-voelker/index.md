Even though I fell in love with web development as soon as a teen, it took me a decade long detour through humanities to end up working professionally in the field. 
What never left me was the passion for websites that can be enjoyed by everyone. We can't have the magic of the early 2000s web, if we exclude a huge part of the public by inaccessible design, bloated websites that don't run on old hardware and walled gardens. I try to learn about all things that make websites more accessible and to discuss it with others, so that we can all build a better, more inclusive web.

Which is what brought Lina and me together, on a quest to raise awareness about motion sickness triggered by web design and to bring people together to discuss creative solutions.
