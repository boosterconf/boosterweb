I am a solution architect and tech lead at Instech (Insurance Technology Solutions AS). We create software for the marine insurance industry. I have about 20 years of experience. Been working for both startups and bigger organizations, it has been mainly finance related. Our tech stack is Microsoft/Azure based. When it comes to presenting, I have done several sessions/talks internally within the company on a wide range of topics. I did lightning talks at booster 2022 (MDM Pattern) and 2023 (Internal tech talks). I also had a talk at Feilefest 22. The topic then was "How to not to use a document database".
