I am a solution architect at Instech (Insurance Technology Solutions AS). We create software for the marine insurance industry. I have about 20 years of experience. Been working for both startups and bigger organizations, it has been mainly finance related. Our tech stack is Microsoft/Azure based. When it comes to presenting, I have done several sessions/talks internally within the company. A selection of topics: * Azure Functions * SQL - the dos and don'ts when it comes to query performance * Benchmarking your code in C# * Async programming in C# * Unit testing basics (using XUnit). I did a lightning talk at booster 2022 (MDM Pattern). I really enjoyed attending :). I also had a talk at feilefest.22. The topic was "How to not use a document database". I did not find a video recording of that last one.
