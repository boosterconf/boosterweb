I am a solution architect at Instech (Insurance Technology Solutions AS). We create software for the marine insurance industry. I have about 20 years of experience. Been working for both startups and bigger organizations, it has been mainly finance related. Our organization's tech stack is based on Microsoft Azure, so I have a lots of knowledge when it comes to this cloud provider. Our organization has been working in close relationship with Microsoft to develop some of our products through the Azure Fast Track program. 

I have not given talks at conferences before, but I have had several sessions/talks internally. A selection of topics:
* Azure Functions
* SQL - the dos and don'ts when it comes to query performance
* Benchmarking your code in C#
* Async programming in C#
* Unit testing basics (using XUnit)
