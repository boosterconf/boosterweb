MSc in Software Development from IT-University of Copenhagen

Many years experience (too many?) as independent consultant, and later as senior systems developer for Delfi Data and the Norwegian Institute of Public Health

Knows several languages more or less fluently: Cobol, Italian, Danish, Delphi, SQL, English, Java... Native languages are C# and Norwegian

Currently slightly retired but still doing a lot of things that I find interesting
