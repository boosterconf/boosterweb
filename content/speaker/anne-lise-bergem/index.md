20 years experience as a Product designer. I work as a Human Centred Designer at Equinor. For the past 12 years I have been designing digital products and services for clients in a range of industries; financial, energy, health, education, media and games. I have had roles like lead designer, service designer & UX/UI designer. My education is a MS in Industrial Design from the Oslo School of Architecture, the Norwegian Entrepreneurship School, and I have an Executive Master in Strategic Design for Innovation - Design Thinking from NHH/HVL/UIB. I also teach design thinking and I am a DT mentor. I bring curiosity and care for the user to the team :) Discovery and conceptualisation are my strengths. 
Want to know more? I am a Mom of 2, living in Bergen for more than a decade! I love Argeninean tango and to sew and knit my own clothes.  I host a private wine club as Madam Pinot and I love good tea and yoga!
