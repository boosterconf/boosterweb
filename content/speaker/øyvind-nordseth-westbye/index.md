Øyvind Nordseth Westbye is a UX and design leader with 15+ years of experience turning complex systems into products people actually understand. With a background that straddles computer science, consultancy and design leadership, he’s mildly obsessed with how we talk to users – and how easily we fool ourselves when we don’t. At Booster he’ll share his hard-earned lessons on story-based interviewing, honest discovery, and avoiding the trap of building beautifully polished, completely wrong features.
