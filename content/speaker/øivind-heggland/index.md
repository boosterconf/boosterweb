Product Owner  with a strong background in agile organizations. I collaborate effectively with diverse roles such as product owners, developers, and QA teams to ensure efficient project execution. My solid experience in stakeholder management enables me to understand and prioritize stakeholder needs, contributing to better decision-making and project outcomes.

With a Master’s degree in Applied Computer Science, I’ve served as a Tech Lead on several projects, including data migration to SharePoint and the development of IoT solutions. I have a strong operational focus and am passionate about helping teams create value while working in ways that align with both team dynamics and organizational goals.
