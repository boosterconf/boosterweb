Øivind Heggland is a Product Owner and CTO at Aquateknikk who knows that "Agile" on a whiteboard doesn't mean a team actually works together. With a Master's in Applied Computer Science and hands-on experience building IoT solutions, Azure integrations, and leading digitalization projects, he brings technical credibility to the conversation. Certified PSM II and PSPO II, Øivind has coached teams, facilitated workshops, and seen the patterns that separate real collaboration from the illusion of it. He's passionate about helping teams move beyond rituals and ticket ownership toward genuine shared accountability.
