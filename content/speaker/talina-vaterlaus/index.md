Talina Vaterlaus is a DevOps Specialist at Fjord Line AS with a past in IT Operations, a former life as a PR consultant, and a stint in the Swiss military to round it all out. After years of keeping systems from crashing, she now automates infrastructure, wrangles CI/CD pipelines, and keeps cloud environments and Kubernetes clusters from spiraling into chaos. She prefers her infrastructure reliable, her tooling sharp, and her logs just chatty enough to flag when something’s off.
