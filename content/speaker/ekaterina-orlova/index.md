Ekaterina Orlova is a passionate front-end developer dedicated to creating beautiful and accessible digital experiences. Armed with degrees in both philosophy and programming, she delights in exploring the deeper meanings behind her code—because who doesn’t love a good existential question between debug sessions? As a certified Scrum Master, she thrives on agile methodologies that fuel collaboration and innovation. With a portfolio that includes major clients like Telenor, KLP, and now OBOS, she navigates the tech landscape with a blend of skill and humor. A champion for diversity and inclusion, Ekaterina has led initiatives for women in tech, organized workshops on accessibility, and proudly served as a former co-organizer of the Mobile Era conference. When she’s not immersed in code or sharing her insights at tech conferences, she’s keeping up with the delightful chaos brought on by her two energetic kids.
