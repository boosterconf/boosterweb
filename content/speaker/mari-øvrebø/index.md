Mari recently graduated with a master’s degree in Interaction Design from NTNU, where she explored how design can help people make more energy-conscious decisions. Through her thesis work, she spent countless hours involving users, testing ideas, and uncovering what actually motivates people to change behavior, and what is just distracting.

She now works as a designer and consultant at Variant, helping teams create meaningful, user-centered digital experiences. Mari is passionate about sustainability, systems thinking, and the small design choices that can drive big impact. When she’s not designing, she’s probably on a ferry, still thinking about energy.
