I really just like building things- websites, APIs, teams, whatever is needed. I've been lucky enough to stumble into a career in tech, and am currently working as an engineering manager in Vipps. I started out in 2000 just before the dot-com crash, learned how to properly code somewhere along the way, worked with some big companies that needed scale and cool startups that needed a bit of everything. These days I'm enjoying the good life in Norway, hopefully speaking passable Norwegian, and enjoying brown cheese sandwiches.

I gave this talk at Y Oslo this year, which can see on YouTube here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVe2V57BoIc
I'm always doing small updates to the talk, but it would be largely the same.
