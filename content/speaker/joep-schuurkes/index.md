Joep wandered into software testing in 2006. After a decade of both exploratory testing and test automation, his focus shifted to a bigger question. How can teams and organizations build and deliver good software? To answer that question, he has been exploring topics such as technical leadership, quality engineering, and software methodologies.

Joep has given talks and workshops at conferences throughout Europe. He's also one of the organizers of the Friends of Good Software unconference (FroGS conf).
