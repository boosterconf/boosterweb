Hi! I'm Charles Aleksander Ravndal, and I live in beautiful Bergen, Norway. I work as a Senior Advisor in User Experience and Design at Skatteetaten (The Norwegian Tax Administration), where I help make digital services easy to use and accessible for everyone. Before this, I was a Senior UX Designer at Sparebanken Vest, working on improving the experience for users of the bank's website and services. I also spent nine years as a concept developer at Bergens Tidende/Schibsted, helping businesses connect with their customers. Outside of work, I love good typography, simple design, cooking, and being creative with photography and interior design.
