As an IT team lead/team coach Maja is known for her caring and compassionate way of relating to others, and her engaging way of inspiring her co-workers. She thinks the magic lies in the teams ability to cooperate and feel safe with each other and is eager to facilitate this whenever she gets the opportunity to do so. She is an avid supporter of the idea that the client/supplier relationship greatly benefits a partner mind-set where both parties share risk and trust. Since 2002 she has played different roles in the team management universe and worked in many different types of teams, with many different type of clients.
