Siv loves creating software, preferably together with other people. She works both as a developer and a team lead. A strong passion for teaching and outreach led her to help found the Nerdschool meetup and teach fundamental software engineering skills at the University of Bergen. She is still actively engaged in teaching newcomers to our field about craftsmanship of developing software.
