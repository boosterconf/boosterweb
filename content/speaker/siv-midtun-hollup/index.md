Siv loves creating software, preferably together with other people. She works both as a developer, mentor and team lead, and has been teaching and mentoring for over 20 years. The passion for teaching and outreach led her to help found the Nerdschool meetup, help create technical onboarding courses and teach fundamental software engineering skills at the University of Bergen. She is actively engaged in teaching newcomers to our field about craftsmanship of developing software and also spends time encouraging girls to choose tech and IT as a career path.
