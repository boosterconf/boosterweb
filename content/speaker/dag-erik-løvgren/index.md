Dag Erik hails from the southern part of Norway, and became interested in programming from an early age. Modding games started a path that would lead to a Masters Degree in Computer Science at NTNU, specializing in Interaction Design and Game Development.

His career has taken him a step from game development, and he's currently working as an IT Consultant at Miles Bergen, where he specializes in frontend web development. Dag Erik loves the ever-changing landscape of the frontend, and jumps at any opportunity to learn a new technology, framework, or language. And if there's an opportunity to share in that learning with others: all the better!
