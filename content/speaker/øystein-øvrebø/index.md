Øystein Øvrebø is a tech lead at Sopra Steria in Bergen, Norway. He has worked on creating software in teams since back in the olden (but not golden) days when Java was still in version 1. Remember when XML was cool? He does. And he might blabber on endlessly about it if you will let him. You should not.
