Maja works with an awesome team at the Senter for Kvalitet i Legetjenester (a foundation for quality improvement in Norwayâ€™s primary healthcare services). Professionally speaking, sheâ€™s into stuff at the intersection of dev and design and all things process and quality improvement. Unprofessionally speaking, she into shiny thingsâ€”parrots, tropical plants, obnoxious nail polish. Also Wittgenstein and powerlifting. Please come say hi to her if you like any of these, too. ðŸ˜„
