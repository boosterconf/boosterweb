- I have worked with startups, and SMEs with a focus of converting business requirements to technology. 
- In the past, was a data engineer helped media companies, fintech companies to take faster data driven decisions, optimizing time from days to hours and hours to seconds.  
- Part of Infrastructure and SRE team enabling product teams to ship faster and often across cloud and private data-centres.  
- Besides functional aspects of software, I identify non-functional requirements like scalability, availability, maintainability and security of systems.
- Overall, I would summarize have evolved from buzzword driven development to Impact driven development (in terms of cost, time and culture).
