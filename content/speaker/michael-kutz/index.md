I've been working in professional software development for more than 10 years now. I love to write working software and I hate fixing bugs. Hence I developed a strong focus on test automation, continuous delivery/deployment and agile principals. Since 2014 I work at digital as a software engineer and since 2018 as quality engineer. As such my main objective is to support our development teams in QA and test automation to empower them to write awesome bug-free software fast.
