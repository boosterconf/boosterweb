Henrik is a really lazy developer (hence all the automation focus!) working as a solutions architect at Sparebanken Vest in Bergen. When he is not working on the security software at SPV, Henrik takes his kayak for a spin or runs around a track really slowly. He is passionate about sharing tips & tricks and lessons learned so that others can (more) safely navigate the dangerous waters of tech.
