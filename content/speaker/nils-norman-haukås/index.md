Hi! 

I lead a one-person technology studio named Builder Heart where I dream up, and make programs for people. Also, I like to blog and share my findings with others. 

Currently dabbling in running my own infrastructure using Ansible, learning Linux system administration, and deploying Common Lisp (or Clojure) in the wild.
