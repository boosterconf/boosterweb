I started as a developer, but quickly discovered an interest in process improvement, project management and team management. Through my career, I have worked closely with many different development teams and different variants of agile methods to optimize the development process. 
In Capra, I was part of the management team until it was replaced by teams based on the "Team Topologies" model. From then on I have worked on our new organization, first by starting the team responsible for the new organization, and later through other teams working on continuous improvements. 
I am from Bergen, but moved to Oslo as a student. Today I am a consultant at Capra - and right now I'm working on a project at NRK.
I have two girls, one husband and a dog :)
