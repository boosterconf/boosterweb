Filip has a background in Economics and Health, but never really liked crunching numbers. During the pandemic, he suddenly had a lot of spare time on his hands. So he decided to do a career switch. Inspired by his love of automating all the things, he learned programming. Suddenly, he was employed at Amedia where his team was creating the award winning ALT.no app. Now, he is working on internal AI tooling at Amedia while quietly revolutionizing the recruitment space in his spare time.
