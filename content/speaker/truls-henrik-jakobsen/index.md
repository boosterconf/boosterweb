Hallaien, I'm Truls!

I work as a consultant and developer for Variant in Bergen. I've been interested computers for as long as I can remember and have always had a knack for reading manuals (very handy!). I like making silly programs in functional languages and teaching things. One of my favorite things is seeing other people experience the a-ha moment of suddenly getting a concept and then being flooded with inspiration and making new brain connections. Please come talk to me if you find me, my talk, or yourself interesting!
