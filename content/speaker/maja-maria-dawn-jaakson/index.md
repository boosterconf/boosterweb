Maja has an academic background in philosophy, linguistics and logic and a professional background in web dev and agile coaching. She had the pleasure and good fortune of joining the Equinor Design System (EDS) Core Team in 2023 as a UX Engineer. Professionally speaking, sheâ€™s into stuff at the intersection of dev and design and all things process, collaboration and quality improvement. She is also one of the organizers of the Frontiers Bergen meetup group.

Unprofessionally speaking, she into shiny thingsâ€”parrots, tropical plants, obnoxious nail polish. Also Wittgenstein and powerlifting. Please come say hi to her if you like any of these, too. ðŸ˜„
