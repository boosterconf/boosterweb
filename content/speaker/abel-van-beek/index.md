Abel van Beek is a software developer with a passion for front-end magic and creating kick-ass user experiences. It is not only about software either: he is about making it accessible for everyone, inclusive, and a force for good. His Dutch roots show not just in his love for chocolate sprinkles, but also in his pragmatic approach to complex issues.

At Vizrt, he tightly integrated their design system workflow with the LEGO blocks he created to quickly build and maintain accessible web applications. When not behind his desk, he is running, skiing and climbing outside of the digital box 🏃⛷️🧗
