Hi, my name is Jakob! ðŸ‘‹

I work as a developer and consultant for Variant Trondheim and I'm a life-long computer nerd. Day-to-day I spend most of my time working frontend with a great group of people (my team), but I love diving into other parts of the stack from time to time, such as our deployment pipelines. Besides technology my biggest passion is teaching. I worked as a part-time private teacher throughout all my years as a student, and I love the challenge of communicating something difficult in an interesting and understandable way, something that will hopefully shine through in my talk!

If you find me, talk to me about anything you're passionate about, one of my favorite activities is hearing people nerd out about something!
