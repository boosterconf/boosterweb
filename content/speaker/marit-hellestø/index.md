Im Marit I currently work as a Team leader/Developer at Casi AS. This is my first inhouse experience as I´ve been a consultant for the last 8 years, having touched upon most types of development, from large backend projects, small websites, app development and so on.

The most fun part of the job is to challenge myself and learn new things, preferrably outside my comfort zone, which is also why I'm trying my hand at holding a talk at a conference.
