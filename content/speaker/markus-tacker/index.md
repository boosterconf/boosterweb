Markus is a coder by heart and an organizational hacker by passion. As a software crafter he uses his 20+ years of experience working as a developer, consultant, coach, mentor, and founder to build cloud-based solutions for the Internet of Things. His professional career has been greatly influenced by taking an active role in communities, whether as a participant, contributor, initiator, or speaker.

He lives in Trondheim, Norway and enjoys plowing through deep snow on snowshoes and enjoys Scandinavia's beautiful nature in his black campervan.
