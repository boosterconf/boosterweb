With a background in Applied Mathematics (MSc) and Reservoir Simulation (PhD), I'm currently a Principal Software Engineer at Equinor.

I'm leading a project with industry-transforming potential in Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS). We're developing an open-source platform, AcidWatch, that enables researchers to analyze CO2 impurities and mitigate corrosion risks 🌍 Check it out here: https://acidwatch.radix.equinor.com/

When I'm not busy saving the planet one line of code at a time, you can find me honing my public speaking skills 🎤 (watch out, TED stage!). I'm also passionate about community building and organizing conferences that foster collaboration🤝

I am always happy to talk about the future of CCS, ensemble methods, or exchange tips on public speaking!
