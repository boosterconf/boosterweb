Currently thinking big, inventing and simplifying for my customers as a Senior Solutions Architect in AWS. With a long tenure of working in technologies, from enterprise leadership roles to being a co-founder in my own startup, I have always been a software engineer at heart. Building products to solve customer problems is my craft. I am equally passionate about creating an innovative, and inclusive culture that is grounded in an unrelenting curious mindset.
