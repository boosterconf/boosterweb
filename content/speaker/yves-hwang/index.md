Currently thinking big, inventing and simplifying for my customers as a Senior Solutions Architect in AWS. I am a co-founder of wanda.space and a software engineer at heart. Building products is my craft as is my passion for creating a team culture that is innovative, inclusive, diverse, and based on a growth mindset that loves learning and seeks to solve challenging problems.
