I have been working around 20 years in IT, currently as Agile Lead and Tester in Sparebanken Vest.
I have passion for quality issuance, automation, and team processes.
I am from beautiful Ukraine, where I studied and started my career path: developer, QA and team lead. Since that I have been working in few companies in Norway, both with international and local teams.
I like to say that each developer is different, I like to learn their preferable way of working and find the best way of collaborating.
