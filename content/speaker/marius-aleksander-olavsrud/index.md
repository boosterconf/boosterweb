I have worked in Atea since August 2020. I have a master’s degree in Data Science from NMBU in Ås and a bachelor degree in economics and math from University of Wyoming, USA. I work as a senior consultant with machine learning cases, data engineering cases and some BI projects. I have also taken much responsibility in building a data science group  within Atea and I talk about the opportunities with Machine learning for larger communities. I have two years in a row been part of Atea Community where I have talked about two different machine learning projects. Atea Community take place in multiple cities and this year I have talked in Oslo, Trondheim, Stavanger, Bergen, Ålesund and Kristiansand.
