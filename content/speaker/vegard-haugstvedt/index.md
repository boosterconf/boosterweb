An enthusiastic accessibility advocate, usually talking about WCAG, WAI-ARIA, A11Y and other abbreviations.

As a frontend developer, Vegard enjoys working on the "front of frontend", in the intersection between programming and UX, and his goal is that the services he works on should be accessible to everyone, regardless of their preferred platform or their abilities.

After recently building welfare services and design systems at Nav for a few years, he currently enjoys being able to talk about the weather all day at work while building Yr.no.
