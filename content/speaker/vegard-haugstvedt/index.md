Vegard is an experienced frontend developer and accessibility specialist. During the last couple of years, he has been building forms and nerding about accessibility at NAV. He is a regular speaker at Norwegian software conferences. He "emigrated" from Bergen about 15 years ago and ended up in Oslo, but loves coming home to attend Booster.

For those who met him at Booster previously: Unfortunately, the kids and wife had to stay at home this time.
