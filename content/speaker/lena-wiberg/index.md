Lena is the author/creator of “Would Heu-risk it?” - a book and a card deck around risk and software testing. She is also Engineering Manager at Mentimeter, where she works on growing people and scaling the engineering organisation. Using her long background in development
and testing as a base, she now uses her skills on scaling others rather than software. She believes continuous improvement is something we should all strive for by keeping up to date and always challenge ourselves, our assumptions and the way things are done. You can find her on twitter @lenapejgan, pejgan.se and Linkedin
