Hey guys, nice to meet you. :)

I'm an experienced web developer, specializing in CSS, design systems, animations, and creative coding. I have a pathological curiosity and a constant desire to learn new things, and I love sharing my experience and explorations with the community.

I've been a speaker at a large number of local and international conferences, and countless meetups, talking about CSS and JavaScript, or doing some live-coding, and I'm a frequent guest at professional podcasts and various streams. I've also published a few professional articles, and my work is frequently featured on some of the most respectable websites and newsletters.
