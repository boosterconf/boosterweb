Eva PenzeyMoog is a US-based activist and designer working to make digital spaces safer for everyone through centering the safety of survivors of domestic violence. 

In the past, Eva served as a rape crisis counselor, where she served as an advocate to sexual assault victims in emergency rooms. She also delivered a workshop on domestic violence and survivor support information to hundreds of participants, including educators, school support staff, and union groups. After entering the technology field as a designer, she began to focus on the intersections of technology and domestic violence. In 2019, she created the “Framework for Inclusive Safety,” which aims to help other technologists create safe and inclusive products. She is currently creating a set of standards for online and digital safety aimed at helping designers and programmers create safe products.

Eva leads design at an ag-tech company based in the midwest of the US, where she lives with her family. When not designing and thinking about safety, she can be found making cyanotype prints, reading apocalyptic novels, and working on new writing projects.
