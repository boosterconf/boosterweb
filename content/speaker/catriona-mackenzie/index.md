Originally hailing from London, Catriona left the high-pressure world of financial IT in 2012 to enjoy a more relaxed pace of life in the beautiful, mountainous city of Bergen, Norway, where she took up a new career as a web developer. Since then she has worked with various back-end web technologies before finally landing her dream role as front-end developer, and now spends most of her days wrestling with CSS in an attempt to turn designersâ€™ wishes into reality. Catriona is passionate about making the web look as beautiful as possible, and adding extra finishing touches to delight her users.
