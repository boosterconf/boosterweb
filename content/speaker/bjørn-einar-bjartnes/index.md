.NET developer and architect with a keen interest in Domain Driven Design and Lean principles. Currently working in 4Subsea with https://4insight.io/.
Worked six years in the exciting streaming market for NRK, Norway's public broadcaster. I have a background from the oil & gas industry and spent my first year after university on drilling rigs and several years after that on production facilities working with distributed process control systems.

My main interests are best summed up from my latest blog posts https://nrkbeta.no/dev
