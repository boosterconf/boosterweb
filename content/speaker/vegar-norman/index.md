I am a web designer who enjoys working somewhere inbetween design and code, mostly with large-scale web portals and design systems. I love working with accessibility and challenges that involves the end user, and how we as developers can make the web a better place for everyone. I spend my free time as a moderator in Norsk programmering, the largest Discord server for Norwegian coders, and focus my efforts around creating a community that is open and welcoming to everyone, no matter the skill level or ambition.
