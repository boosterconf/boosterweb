Domain-Driven Design Coach at CoWork, Norway One of CoWorkers at CoWork, Norway, a consultancy travelling together with the customers on their IT-transformation journey. I have 20+ years of experience as software architect, developer and coach, in telecom and healthcare, thus being deeply involved in developing enterprise-solutions in complex domains. The major part of the last 10 years of my professional career has been devoted to leading and coaching different development teams, by cultivating knowledge sharing in the organization and increasing co-developer’s business understanding. My professional philosophy is rooted in Domain-Driven Design and in building agile and technical coaching culture on an organization-wide level. Apart from work I enjoy spending time engaging my kids in STEM activities. I am an enthusiastic First Lego League mentor and have actively contributed to the FIRST community locally and internationally.
