I lead a team of exceptional product developers and marketing professionals who deliver innovative solutions within managed networking (WAN/LAN) and cybersecurity to help enterprises safely bridge the gap between cloud and on-prem resources.

In addition to a master's degree in GIS and Remote Sensing, I am a certified project management professional with both PMP and Prince2 and a certified AEM practioner/consultant.  In my spare time I am co-developer of "The Forecast Exchange", a software for improving communication flow in project oriented organizations. I am also chairman of the board of a small IT consultancy company.

I love working to develop people and organisations to meet strategic goals. Moving diversity initiatives beyond inclusion and into real belonging is my passion!
