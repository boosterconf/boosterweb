Kristian used to be a developer, but sometime around 2013 crossed over to security and haven't really looked back since. He holds a masters degree in Information Security and has worked on security issues in various industries. Currently he works as Chief Information Security Officer in KS Digital and insists that he solves problems, not create them.
