I am a technology-interested designer with a primary area of expertise in UX/UI design and digital product design. As CDO at Variant in Bergen, I help my clients to design products that bring value to their users and their organisation. 

In addition to my passion for design, I am also interested in team culture and interdisciplinary collaboration, especially between designers and developers. 

Outside work I like to enjoy food and drinks, especially craft beer. I am also a big fantasy nerd and might know as much about fictional worlds as I do the real one. I believe that inspiration can be found in the strangest of places!
