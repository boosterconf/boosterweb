I'm a software developer and consultant at Tietoevry in Bergen. My passion for technology sparked with my very first PC and has grown ever since. Over the years, I've dedicated myself to mastering best practices and theories in various programming disciplines. My enthusiasm for Git has made me the go-to guy in our company. I'm excited to share my insights and learnings as I make my debut at the Booster conference.
