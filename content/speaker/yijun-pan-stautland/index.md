I'm backend developer at Bulder Bank. My passion for technology sparked with my very first PC and has grown ever since. Over the years, I've dedicated myself to mastering best practices and theories in various programming disciplines.I enjoy contributing to conferences and believe they offer a fantastic opportunity for learning and knowledge sharing.
