Building and scaling a UX Research practice within a business is no small feat, especially when transitioning from a start-up to a corporate environment. 

In this talk, I will share my journey of introducing UX Research in different business contexts, from gaining stakeholder buy-in to integrating research into product roadmaps and business strategies.

You'll learn practical tips on how to build trust, scale research impact from tactical to strategic, and create a people-centric approach that drives business outcomes. 

Expect honest lessons, real-life examples, and actionable insights to help you navigate and elevate UX Research within any organisation.
