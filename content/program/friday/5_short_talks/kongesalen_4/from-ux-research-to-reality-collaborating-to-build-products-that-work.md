Great products aren’t built by UX research alone. They’re built when researchers, designers, product managers and developers collaborate around real user needs and technical constraints.

In this talk, I’ll share practical learnings from my journey as a solo UX researcher on how to scale research impact through collaboration, and how this directly contributes to building products that are desirable for users, feasible to deliver, and viable for the business.

You’ll learn how research can fit into everyday product delivery, how non-researchers can start thinking like users, and what effective collaboration actually looks like across disciplines.

Expect honest lessons, real case studies, and actionable ways to work better together - based on what’s worked, what hasn’t, and what I’d do differently next time!
