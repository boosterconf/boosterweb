The Commodore Amiga was the worlds best home computer until 1994. It had fantastic graphics capabilities, great games, and you could even do homework on it if you wanted (yeah right).

Ricki stopped using his Amiga back in the 90s, but recently retreived it from the attic again after spending a couple of years developing games for the even older Commodore 64. He has been developing a new Amiga game the last 1.5 years, and is ready to share his experiences!

You will get insight into the history of the Commodore Amiga, a few funny stories, and learn how it is to develop games on this 39 year old machine with modern tools.
