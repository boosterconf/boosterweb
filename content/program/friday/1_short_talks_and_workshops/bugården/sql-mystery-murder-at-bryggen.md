Want to freshen up your SQL skills? How long has it been since you wrote some direct and complex queries, and not only joins or simple selections? Time to change that. Inspired by the OG SQL Murder Mystery (by Northwestern University Knight Lab), we have created a scenario in Bergen, and it is your job to solve the murder. Your tools? SQL queries. Let’s see if your detective skills are sufficient to find out who did the murder! Maybe there are twists to the tale that you need to solve?

In this interactive workshop session, we're going to explore datasets in a SQL Murder Mystery.
There will be three tasks to complete;
- Who did it?
- What was their motive?
- What was the murder weapon?

The tasks will become increasingly difficult, so there will be something for everyone! Don’t worry if you're not an expert, we will go through some examples and refresh your memory on SQL before the investigation starts. If you get stuck, there might be some help along the way ;) 

What do you need?
- Creativity, of course. 
- Your own computer

By the end of this workshop you will have (re)discovered both the fun and power of SQL and how it can be used to collect information in a useful (and creative) way!
