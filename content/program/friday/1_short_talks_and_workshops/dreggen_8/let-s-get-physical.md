Most of us spend an ungodly number of hours â€” often seated â€” in front of our machines. And those of us whoâ€™ve been in the game for a little while know all too well that the IT-worker lifestyle sure can take a toll on the body. ðŸ™ˆ

 

But it doesnâ€™t have to be that way! ðŸŽ‰ Join us for a unique, super hands-on session where you'll learn a ton of practical tips for offsetting workâ€™s wear and tear on your body and mind. Guided by a developer with over 20 years of experience in physiotherapy, weâ€™ll practice techniques for managing stress and preventing our postures from getting even worse. None of these activities require equipment beyond your desk and chair. And theyâ€™re great to practice after hours of sitting and watching conference talks! ðŸ˜‰

 

* Please note that this workshop includes some exercises involving physical touch between participants. All exercises are optional; participants can skip them if they please.
