This is a 3 hour workshop for people that want to get an introduction to the principles and mindset of design thinking via a practical case. We go through all 5 phases together. They are; empathy, define, ideation, prototype and test. We will work with pen and paper, and physical workshop material. The methodology is based on the framework of d.school Stanford. Hopefully you will have some new tools and techniques to bring back to your own work and some fun together!
