Is the concept of «imposter syndrome” unfamiliar to you? Of course not! If you are a developer who haven’t heard of or felt the imposter syndrome then you are definitely the exception and not the rule. So how to overcome this obstacle, find the confidence in yourself and reach your potential? In this session you will hear from two people who have been in the industry for over 20 years. They will share their aspect both as developers and as females on how the imposter syndrome have affected them, what they have learnt and where the journey has taken them. (Note! This session will be held in Norwegian!)
