Yr is a collaboration between the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation (NRK) and the Norwegian Meteorological Institute (MET). This collaboration has been crucial in the process of building our flexible map solution.

In this talk we will recount parts of how we built our current map solution, starting with no prior knowledge of WebGL or shader programming.  Using these technologies combined with the open-source library MapLibre, we have created map layers displaying wind, temperature, lightning and precipitation. 

We are going to put a spotlight on our lightning map, which processes and visualizes real-time data within seconds after a lightning strike.  We’ll dive into the challenges, the tech we used, and how we made this map come to life.  

Whether you're a developer or a weather enthusiast, this talk will give you a glimpse into the tools and technology behind our map solution.
