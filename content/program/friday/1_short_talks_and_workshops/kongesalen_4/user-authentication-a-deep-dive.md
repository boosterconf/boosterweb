In this workshop we’ll explore how user authentication works, risks involved, and common attacks targeting authentication systems. Through a mix of lectures, group discussions, and hands-on labs, you’ll develop a stronger understanding of secure authentication principles.

This workshop is ideal for anyone involved in designing or building applications that require user authentication. By the end, you'll have a clearer understanding of authentication challenges and strategies, making it easier to address them in your future projects.
