In Norway alone, we throw away more than 105 million loaves of bread every year. According to Matsjokket, a documentary about food waste in Norway, presented by NRK, this is about Â¼ of all food waste. About 40 million of these loaves are not even touched by a household, they are baked, transported to a store, to be thrown directly.

In this session we will demonstrate how we have helped Bunnpris, a Norwegian grocery chain, in taking responsibility and action towards a more sustainable and data driven society. You will learn more about how we have produced and implemented a machine learning model to reduce food waste. We will present our work methodology and what have been important in the machine learning journey and succession factors in the production phase.
