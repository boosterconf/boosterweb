ðŸŽ¢ An actually interactive accessibility workshop about motion sickness 

Join us for an engaging workshop where we'll explore accessibility beyond screen readers and alternative inputs. We'll dive into the super specific problem of motion sickness and discover how addressing it will shape your thinking patterns for more inclusive product decisions.

Despite the tummy-turning title, this hands-on workshop is a lot of fun. Thereâ€™s a 10min introduction to the world of motion sensitivities, the remaining 85% of the workshop is pure interaction. If attendees share firsthand motion sickness experiences (spoiler: they always do!), accessibility becomes tangible. Go to the office on Monday, give your colleagues of all disciplines the tl;dr and scroll through your website or app together to see where it might trip affected people. Then collectively implement solutions.

Note: The maximum number of participants is 18 persons, first-come-first-serve basis.
It would be cool if ~5 people bring their own laptops to try and demo things, but an own device is not required.

Target audience:
It takes the whole team to make products truly accessible, so every role is needed :)
