Curious about how modern AI agents can connect to external tools and services? Join this hands-on workshop and learn to build and extend an AI agent system using the Model Context Protocol (MCP)!

You’ll get a practical introduction to MCP architecture and discover how to develop your own “tools” that empower your agent—from weather data and news to calendar integration and notifications. Learn how the agent leverages OpenAI, how to containerize everything with Docker, and how to easily expand the system with new features.

Through guided exercises, you’ll build and register your own tools, integrate them into the agent, and master testing, debugging, and setting up a robust development environment. We’ll also cover essential topics like security, scaling, and monitoring—everything you need to take your AI agent from idea to production.

This workshop is perfect for developers, technologists, and AI enthusiasts who want to understand how to build the smart assistants of tomorrow. Bring your curiosity and creativity — we’ll provide the tools!
