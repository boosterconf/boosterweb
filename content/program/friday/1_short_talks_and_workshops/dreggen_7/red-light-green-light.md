Join our workshop where we dive into cutting edge computer vision models and how they can be used to create your very own rendition of the classic schoolyard game "Red light, Green light".

Participants will learn how to harness a smartphone's camera, process a live video feed, and use a pre-trained pose estimation model to detect movement.

Prerequisites:
 - A laptop
 - A smartphone with cable that connects to your laptop.

To make the initial setup more smooth it is also advised to go through the setup guide for Flutter.
