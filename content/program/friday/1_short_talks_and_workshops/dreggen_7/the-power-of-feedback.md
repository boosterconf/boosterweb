During this thought-provoking and fun workshop we will obtain the skills of giving a feedback that encourages to grow and succeed. I'm a big fan of the "learning by doing" approach, thus there will be a lot of activities and very little teaching in a workshop. Attendants will leave a room with a set of tools that will become handy already that same day.
