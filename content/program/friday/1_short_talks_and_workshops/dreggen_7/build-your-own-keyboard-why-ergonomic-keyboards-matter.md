A lot of people build their own keyboards to get the perfect fit for their hands, and we will teach you how to solder, desolder, and how to build your own minikeyboard (a macropad), which is a great foundation for a full custom build at a later occasion.

We will bring a selection of ergonomic keyboards for you to program, and of course, try for yourself!

The instructors are keyboard enthusiasts, both for hobbyist and health reasons.
