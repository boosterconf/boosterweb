Companies have begun adopting platform engineering practices to address the increasing complexity of modern software architectures. As concepts from Team Topologies have gained popularity, more organizations are investing in building platforms, complex subsystems, and other products for internal use. They do this to manage software's growing complexity and expense by separating concerns into micro-services that can be managed in isolation. This allows organizations to have specialist functionality built by experts, while teams without specialized knowledge can use these features through a simplified interaction model.
In this presentation, I will share my experience in building a successful scalable observability platform. Additionally, I will discuss the challenges and cargo cults of adopting product management practices for internal products, and explore the difference between being customer-focused and problem-focused.
