Hi. My name is BÃ¥rd. No, actually, my name is Bård. That is a four letter name. so short and easy you would think even a robot or a child would spell it correctly.
Growing up online with a character in my name that’s not found in the first 127 bytes of unicode, I have been predisposed to be interested in the odd ways of character encoding.
Join me in a journey into the maze of character encoding, and the many ways it can go wrong.
