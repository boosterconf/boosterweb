Agile has been embraced by organizations worldwide to meet the dynamic market conditions and customer demands through iterative development and delivery.  At its core the Agile promise was better, more responsive and efficient ways to deliver software while maintaining a close connection with the customer and empowering teams to innovate and adapt.
 
But there is an increasingly unsettling feeling in many teams and organizations and many are ready to swipe left on Agile due to the pitfalls and missteps on the way. But this is a goldmine that DevOps teams can learn from. In this talk, we will delve into how the overemphasis on processes, tools, metrics, events & high focus on speed of delivery has led to this situation and how DevOps teams can avoid getting burnt by similar pitfalls. We will talk about what really matters to rise above the theatrics to derive real value for your teams and organization.
 
This session will focus on how to get DevOps strategy & implementation right so you can swipe right on DevOps!
