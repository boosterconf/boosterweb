Starting in 2021, I was part of the team that created Florence, a design system made for internal tools and solutions within Norsk Helsenett. Over the course of 16 months, we worked hard to solve multiple challenges: how do you create a design system for an organization with so many different user types, branding needs and technical platforms? And how does working in such a large, sometimes fragmented organization affect technical and design choices in the finalized product?

In this experience report I will talk about how we worked to transform the mindset from "silo thinking" to working with design systems, how a recent switch to Figma helped us with multiple brands existing within Norsk Helsenett, and how we leveraged the web platform using web components in order to help us tackle the multitude of tech stacks and team maturity levels. While Florence as a design system project ultimately was shut down, the learning process of getting there is one worth talking about so others can learn from our gains and also our mistakes.
