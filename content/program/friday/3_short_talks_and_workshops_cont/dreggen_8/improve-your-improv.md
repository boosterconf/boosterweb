Public speaking often range in the top 3 of what people are most afraid of. This workshop aims to challenge this, since improv theatre should fight for first place! 

This is a repeat of last years successful workshop, where over 30 attendees joined in on the fun!

The workshop draws from the speakers experience from improvisational theater, and includes a set of unique exercises that embraces change, welcome failure and cultivate a sense of openness in a supportive environment. 

The exercises you learn at this workshop are perfect for teambuilding at your workplace, all while having an absolute blast.

No prior experience is necessary. The workshop is open to all, regardless of your background. Here's a non inclusive list of what you do NOT need:
You don't need any theater knowledge.
You don't have to be an extrovert.
You don't need to be a student.
You don't even have to consider yourself humorous.
