There is a mismatch between our ideals for digital product development and the reality of it. We speak of bridging the gap between business and IT, taking a seat at the table, direct customer involvement, self-organizing teams owning business outcomes. But the reality is this: Software development teams are like silkworms, living inside a protective terrarium, sheltered from the chaotic, toxic environment of the rest of the business. Autonomy is confined to the walls of the terrarium. So is learning, and so is change. Why did we end up in this situation? Is it the best we can do? Is there life beyond the terrarium?
