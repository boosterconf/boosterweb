In your day-to-day job the opportunity to stop and smell the roses hardly presents itself. Under pressure of producing solutions one rarely reflects and asks big questions like, what is it that we are doing, why do we create software the way we do and where did I leave my favorite mug. In this talk Daan will take you on a personal journey and try to uncover the essence of the nature of code. Guided by his own interests, Daan weaves a tapestry of stories that portraits, at least to him, the binding force in our industry. Join Daan in his quest to unravel the intricacies of our modern society through the lens of software development
