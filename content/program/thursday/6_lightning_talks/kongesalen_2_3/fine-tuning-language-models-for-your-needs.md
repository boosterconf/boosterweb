In our presentation we explain the process of fine-tuning language models for specific domains and challenges one can encounter along the way. When it comes to clinical text-related tasks, Norwegian language models fall short due to the vast differences in terminology and phrasing compared to standard Norwegian text. Therefore we have an ongoing project where Norwegian language models are fine-tuned on clinical data, resulting in a specialised model called Clinical NorBERT. The model will be a valuable asset for addressing the staff shortage problems facing the Norwegian healthcare sector, a problem shared by many other fields.

Key points in talk:
-	Quick intro to language models
-	How to work with sensitive data
-	Training with limited resources
-	Our MLOps process
-	The possibilities with language models

While the presentation looks at our case in the medical sector, the focus is on the project’s technical aspects, and we want to explain how language models can be of great benefit in any industry.
