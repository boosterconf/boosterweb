Let's take a small hop out of our timeline, and into one where we're aspiring Common Lisp developers. 

Common Lisp is a programming language which was originally developed throughout the eighties, and saw its latest ANSI specification in 1994. And while the specification hasn't changed since, there exists a small but thriving ecosystem of developers, who love building with this language. 

In this workshop we'll tackle some real-world exercised using this strange alien technology. We'll start slow and work our way from juggling paranthesises, to defining functions, and all the way up to using macros and leveraging its condition system. 

The intended takeway is for you to have been exposed to a language that's different from the languages you face in your everyday. Maybe you'll be glad you don't work with CL in your everyday, maybe you'll miss it, or maybe you'll draw inspiration from it in your future work.

To attend this workshop you should have downloaded Portacle (https://portacle.github.io/) on beforehand.
