Bring that shiny frontend framework that you have been wanting to try out. I'll bring some data, an API, and a sketch of what we will be building. Let's try something new!

React is everywhere nowadays, but there are so many options that does at least something better, or different. Maybe you want to try out two way data binding in Vue, enterprise frontend in Angular, make something small and fast (and without the VDOM) with svelte, resumable apps on the edge with qwik, islands with deno and fresh, or HTML as it should have been with htmx?

At work you might be tied to React, but here every framework and frontend technology is welcome. Let's build together, and share cool new findings with each other!
