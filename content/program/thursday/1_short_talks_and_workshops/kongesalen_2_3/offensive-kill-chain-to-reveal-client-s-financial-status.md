The ever-evolving landscape of cybersecurity presents new challenges and opportunities as organizations transition from traditional on-premises infrastructures to cloud-based environments. This report describes a real-life chain attack discovered by the offensive team at Storebrand that, if once exploited, would have yielded sensitive financial information about customers. We will examine the key stages of the kill chain, from initial reconnaissance to data exfiltration, and highlight the unique considerations when defending both on-premises and cloud-based assets.
