To facilitate its migration to cloud, DNB Markets has established a platform team. Using platform engineering principles, the team is focused on making developers happier and more productive. At the same time, the team must support our business requirements.

We will share our approach and experiences as a platform team, including how our internal developer portal has made the developer experience better in DNB Markets.
