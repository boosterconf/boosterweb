During an Open Space discussion at last year`s Booster Conference, we discussed the distance between leaders and teams. The gap is real, but it is not there because of bad intentions. Instead, I think the gap exists because it is difficult to see how leaders achieve control by letting go of it. Over the past year leading an area of highly skilled and diverse teams, I have put this into practice. Some things worked, others didn’t, but the consistent theme is that I, as a leader, must prove myself worthy of the team's trust. Perhaps these insights can provide value to others as well?
