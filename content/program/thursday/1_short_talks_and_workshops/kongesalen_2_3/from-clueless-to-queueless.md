In Northern Norway, you are twice as likely to miss a ferry as anywhere else in the country. Combine that with long round-trip times and a massive summer influx of tourists, and you have a recipe for frustration — and a juicy news headline.

Today’s “first come, first served” principle does not scale in the north. Through an interdisciplinary design thinking process involving locals, tourists, ferry crews, and domain experts, we aim to reimagine the ferry journey and eliminate queues across the county.

In this session, we will pull back the curtain on our innovation process and the technology driving it. You will see real-world results from our peak-season pilot, learn how it captured national interest, and leave with a kickass strategy for turning bold ideas into reality.
