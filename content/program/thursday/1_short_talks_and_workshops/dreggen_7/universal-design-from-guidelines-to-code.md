Are you confident your app complies with the new universal design requirements? Do you find the requirements for Universal Design easy to understand? This workshop is not for you!Â 

Join our workshop to learn some simple concepts that will improve the universal design quality of your websites. You will receive a small working web page that unfortunately has been created without accessibility in mind and will gradually make it more and more accessible. On the way, we'll let you use screen readers and show you some tools you can use to test your pages.

This workshop is for everyone who creates HTML as part of their job. You will learn how to use HTML and CSS in a way that makes your app compliant and more accessible for everyone.
