Today, our industry already consumes about 10% of the world's electricity. By 2030, this will double. Not only do we emit as much CO2 as aviation (approximately 4%), but with current energy prices, this becomes very expensive. The next big change in aviation will be planes moving away from fossil fuels (biofuels and/or electric aircraft). While this likely won't happen in the next 10 years, that's the direction they're heading. We, on the other hand, appears to be on an exponential increase in energy consumption and emissions. Yet "flight shame" is a common term, while "Netflix shame" remains unknown. 

Fortunately, each of us can contribute. Faster code makes the CFO, the user, and Earth happier. And the developers have fun days at work. Could it get any better? 

In this workshop, we'll use The One Billion Row Challenge as our starting point to examine how we can measure performance and energy consumption. Then we'll attempt code optimizations to see their effects. 

We'll work with Java code and explore just how far we can push modern Java optimization.
