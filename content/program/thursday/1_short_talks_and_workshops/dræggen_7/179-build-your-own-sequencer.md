The WebAudioAPI is a powerful and fun piece of technology that lives in most browsers. Most of the time we use it to play samples or generate our own sounds, but it also has other interesting properties. Like a very precise and reliable clock. Which we can use, together with the sound emitting capabilities, to build our own step sequencer.

This is supposed to be a fun exploration of a lesser known piece of Browser tech and a way to learn a bit more about scheduling and asynchronous programming in JavaScript.
