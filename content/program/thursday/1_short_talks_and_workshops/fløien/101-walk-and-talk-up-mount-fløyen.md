Fløyen is one of the seven mountains surrounding the city of Bergen. Mount Fløyen is great for hiking and of course a perfect spot for a tech talk.
Together we will go up Tippetue, enjoy a hot chocolate on the top of Fløyen and take the Fløibanen funicular back down to the city.  

The hike itself will be approx one hour and should be suitable for most techies.
