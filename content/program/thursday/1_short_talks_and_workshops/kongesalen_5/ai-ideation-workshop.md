This is a workshop that introduces tools for imagining new AI-driven solutions. We will use AI/ML capability ideation cards. A set of cards to prompt designers in generating ideas to create social, user and business value with machine learning. Participants will experience different ways of visualising and validating their concepts. We will also introduce two key methods (confusion matrix and uncertainty analysis) for validating new potential AI & ML concepts and opportunities.
