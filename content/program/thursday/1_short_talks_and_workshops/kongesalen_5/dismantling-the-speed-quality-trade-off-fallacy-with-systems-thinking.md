The speed / quality trade-off fallacy gets many teams stuck in negative feedback loops -  sacrificing quality for speed, both are lost.

Teams find their backlogs filled with bugs, their stakeholders frustrated by missed deadlines and the teams themselves unhappy and stressed.

Systems thinking, and in particular using causal loop diagrams to identify the feedback loops at play can shed light on how and why the fallacy is so tempting yet so destructive.

By visualising the underlying causes of the problems, we can advocate for the practices of technical excellence - such as collaborative modelling with domain-driven design, test driven development & living documentation - that counter the pressures of the fallacy

In this hands-on lab you'll get practice working with causal loop diagrams - reading and constructing them - and collaborate together to use them to help diagnose the problematic feedback loops in your organisations.
