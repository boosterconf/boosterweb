Let’s practice Git together! Why? Because commits are documentation we leave for the next person. We’ll look at workflows for diffing and staging and stashing — along with operations like interactive rebase. You might want to tweak your Git config and practice writing better commit messages. There will be opportunities to resolve merge conflicts,  or to get into and out of any other Git messes you discover intentionally or by accident. This workshop is for anyone who wants to take a wander with Git, no matter their starting point. Bring a laptop with a terminal!

Wondering if this workshop is for you? Here is a peek at what we will be doing: https://elisabethirgens.github.io/booster2024-git-workshop/
