Everyone says “talk to your users” but what does that really mean in practice?

In this interactive workshop, we’ll explore the power of UX research through a playful, hands-on experience. Based on the classic “Wallet Project,” you’ll pair up, interview, and design for a partner’s needs, but with a UX researcher’s focus.

We’ll cover:

How to plan and run effective user interviews
The differences between research methodologies (when to use what)
How to test and interpret what you learn
How the Double Diamond helps you move from exploration to action

You’ll do research, not just hear about it, experiencing how small shifts in curiosity, questioning, and testing lead to better outcomes.

By the end, you’ll leave with:
A simple framework for running interviews
An understanding of how research fits into product work
Confidence to apply user insights to your next project

This workshop is fun, creative, and designed for everyone who wants to learn how to better learn from your users. Whether you write code, manage products, or test features, you’ll gain a fresh perspective on how to make your work more human-centered.
