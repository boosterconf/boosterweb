This yearâ€™s walk and talk will be up mount Ulriken. With its elevation of 643 meters Ulriken is the highest of the seven mountains surrounding Bergen. Mount Ulriken is great for hiking and of course a perfect spot for a tech talk with the amazing view over the city. 

The hike starts at the ulriken lower station and are well marked all the way up with signs. The main part consists of great stone-built stairs built by Sherpas from Nepal. There are integrated pause benches and viewpoints along the way to the top. Brig suitable clothing, and be prepared for a challenge!

It is a 1.5 hour hike up the Sherpa steps towards Ulriken. On the top we will enjoy a hot chocolate before we take the cable car back down to town.
