With its elevation of 643 meters Ulriken is the highest of the seven mountains surrounding Bergen. Mount Ulriken is great for hiking and of course a perfect spot for tech talks with the amazing view over the city.

The hike starts with a taxi from the hotel to Montana Vandrerhjem Bergen. It is also possible to join the hike directly from Montana Vandrerhjem Bergen at 09:30, but please send a SMS to 47646343 if you intend to do that.

The main part consists of great stone-built stairs built by Sherpas from Nepal. There are integrated pause benches and viewpoints along the way to the top. Brig suitable clothing and be prepared for a challenge!

It is a 1.5 hour hike up the Sherpa steps towards Ulriken. On the top we will enjoy a hot chocolate and good tech discussions before we take the cable car and taxis back to town.
