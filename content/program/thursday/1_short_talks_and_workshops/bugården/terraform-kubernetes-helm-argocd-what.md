What do all these buzzwords mean, and what do they have in common?

Perhaps you have to interact with it daily (and have no clue what you are doing), or perhaps you have a cool SRE team that has abstracted away all the complexity into something self-serviceable. But how does enterprise scale services? What actually happens when you push to Github?

We will learn all about GitOps, and how to set up a small container cluster on your own computer! 

You'll need a computer with access to docker/podman and devbox (https://www.jetify.com/devbox). Or if you do not want to use devbox you need to have: minikube, terraform/opentofu, kubectl, argocd, helm, deno.
