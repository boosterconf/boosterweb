There is no better way to attend a conference than being a speaker. You get a free ticket, bragging rights, and best of all, the conference will treat you like royalty. You might even be invited to a fancy speakers' dinner.

But let's be honest: it's terrifying!
“I have nothing to talk about!”
“I don’t know where to start!”
“What if I forget everything and just stand there!”

The purpose of this workshop is to help you get rid of those excuses. It doesn't matter if you've held a talk before, or this will be your very first. You don’t need a to bring a talk idea. If you don't think anyone would want to hear what you have to say, this is very much for you.

When we’re done, you’ll have the start of your talk, and maybe even the spark (or panic) that makes you want to give it.
