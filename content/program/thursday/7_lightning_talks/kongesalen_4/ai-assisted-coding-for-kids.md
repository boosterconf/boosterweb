You may share my experience trying to teach kids about coding, but learning the hard way that console.log("Hello world") simply doesn't do it. They want to make Fortnite in an hour, and quickly loose interest.

In this talk, I will show how using AI assistants can help making these introductory programming sessions much more interesting, as I will showcase a course I have developed that introduces coding through cool, practical problem solving tasks.

Do you know how many ways a ten-year-old can find to get off a deserted island?
