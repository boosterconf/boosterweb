Giving feedback the right way can help individuals and teams to identify strengths and areas for improvement, fostering a culture of continuous learning and development.

In this lightning talk, we will explore the BIFF model (Behaviour, Impact, Feelings, Future), a simple and effective framework for feedback by Sarah Cartwright. The BIFF model helps us move from vague criticism to meaningful dialogue, focusing on observable behaviour, describing its impact, expressing feelings, and defining a desired future action. It can be used equally powerful on positive as negative feedback. 

Through a short interactive exercise, participants will be challenged to apply the BIFF model to a realistic scenario. Together, we will explore how feedback can strengthen trust, accountability, and collaboration.
