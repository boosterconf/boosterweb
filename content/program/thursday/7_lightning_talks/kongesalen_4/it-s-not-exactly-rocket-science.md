Whats going on outside our atmosphere these days, and why should we care? Christine is currently working as a backend developer for Apparat, but before that she was a researcher on the connection between space and the upper atmosphere. The visual manifestation of this space / atmosphere connection is the aurora. After this talk, you will understand more about what causing the aurora, and maybe also how to predict aurora from satellite data. The peak of Solar Cycle 25 is getting closer, and this talk will present some of the implications that has for us.
