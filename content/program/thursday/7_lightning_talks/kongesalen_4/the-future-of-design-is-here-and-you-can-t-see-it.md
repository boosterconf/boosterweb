From the 1980s until today, design has gone from not matter, to everything that matters, to not matter again. The paradigm of design seems to be changing faster than what we designers have managed to understand. What happens when we do not have any interfaces to design for? And who is actually making the design decisions for our products? 

In this lightning talk we will look at how digital design has changed both visually and conceptually in the last 4 decades and look at the key factors of what designing means in the (artificial) intelligence paradigm of the future! 

This talk is for designers, product people, and leaders who wish to understand the impact you can have on the digital future. 

Buckle up, this talk is both lightning fast and future proof ⚡
