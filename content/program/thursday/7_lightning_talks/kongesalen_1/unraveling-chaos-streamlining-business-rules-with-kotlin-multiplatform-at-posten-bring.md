Do you have a complex business rule-set problem? You know the kind where you have business rules (logic) spread across multiple platforms, systems and applications? Some of them might even be alter egos of the same rule hiding in different apps. You never know which one might turn up where, there is no single source of truth, solving errors takes hours of debugging, and making changes requires (oftentimes) painful coordination across teams and applications (ugh). 

We faced this exact challenge at Posten Bring As - Norwegian National Postal Service founded way back in 1647 - a 377-year-old institution with software spanning more generations than most families! Our business logic was scattered across multiple platforms, some almost as old as the company itself (well, not quite, but it sure felt like it).

In my session I’m spilling the tea. We discover how the team at century-old Norwegian postal services giant tackled modern challenges with cutting-edge technology.

We’ll look through real-world use cases at Posten Bring. We’ll reflect on what we did - key learnings, what went well and most importantly  - what didn’t quite go as planned. We’ll also look through some resources to get started. We'll learn how KMP provides a unified framework for code sharing and execution across various platforms to solve the challenge of different codebases targeting different runtimes.

This talk is for you if troublesome and unruly business logic keeps you up at night and you want that to end NOW. It is also for you if you like to hear a good story.
