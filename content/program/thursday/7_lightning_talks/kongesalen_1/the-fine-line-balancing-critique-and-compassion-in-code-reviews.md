Code reviews are not just a technical exercise but also a human interaction, often bringing into play a delicate balance between critique and emotion. While the aim is to improve code quality, an overlooked aspect is the impact it can have on developers' morale and team dynamics. This lightning talk explores the fine line between providing constructive criticism and hurting someone’s feelings. How can you be candid and effective in your feedback without demoralizing your colleagues? We'll dive into the psychology behind giving and receiving feedback and present actionable tips for ensuring that your code reviews are both effective and empathetic. Using a mix of case studies, best practices, and psychological insights, this talk aims to equip attendees with the tools they need to conduct more human-centered code reviews.
