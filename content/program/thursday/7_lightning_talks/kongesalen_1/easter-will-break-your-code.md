Developers understand that dates can be tricky, but you might not realise how much havoc a moving holiday can wreak. Easter doesn't have a date at all. It moves based on astronomical rules, and drags a bunch of other holidays around in its wake. That will wreck your schedules, payroll systems, and calendar apps if you mess up.

Together we will unpack the Easter algorithm, look at how it shows up in modern software, and why a 4th century decision keeps throwing curveballs at our code. You'll walk away knowing how to calculate it and a renewed respect for how dangerous "simple" date logic really is.
