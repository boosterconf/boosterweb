Every developer know that dates are hard, but few realize just how much chaos one moving Sunday can cause. Easter isn’t fixed; it’s based on ancient astronomical rules, and it quietly drives a whole web of “non-static” holidays that can wreck your schedules, payroll systems, and calendar apps if you get it wrong.

In this talk, we’ll unpack the Easter algorithm, show how it still affects modern software, and explore why something designed in the 4th century still haunts our code today. You’ll leave with a better understanding of how to calculate it — and a renewed respect for just how dangerous “simple” date logic really is.
