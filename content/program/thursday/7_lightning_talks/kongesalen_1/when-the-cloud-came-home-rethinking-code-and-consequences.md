After years of focusing on clean architecture and efficient code, I had an eye-opening moment when plans emerged to build a massive data center down my street. It made me realize that, despite working in tech for over a decade, I had rarely questioned the environmental or societal impact of the systems I help create. Like many, I was a skilled builder but also a passive consumer of infrastructure.

In this talk, I will explore how everyday choices in code, cloud infrastructure, and system design affect far more than we realize, from security and GDPR risks to energy consumption and environmental impact. I’ll share why developers must take an active role in questioning cloud defaults, promoting sovereignty, and building greener, more responsible digital systems.
