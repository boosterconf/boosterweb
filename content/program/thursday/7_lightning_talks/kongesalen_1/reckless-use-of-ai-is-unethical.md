AI technology is being used for everything from helping people with meal planning to programming. However, if we are not conscious of what AI is and its limitations, it could have significant consequences for our future. If we blindly trust that AI data is neutral, we risk developing products and solutions that discriminate.

This talk is not a doomsday warning, but rather a reminder of the potential consequences of using AI, along with a gentle nudge to get ahead of AI's biases.
