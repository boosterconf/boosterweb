We all focus on delivering high quality code, don't we? But what do we mean by this? 

Developers often think it is implied what high quality code means, but I find that we value different qualities. And, let me tell you a secret: You can't have them all! You actually have to choose which qualities are important for you, your team, your situation.

I will strike a blow for always talking about qualities in plural, and deliberately choosing which qualities you will invest in, and which you will not.
