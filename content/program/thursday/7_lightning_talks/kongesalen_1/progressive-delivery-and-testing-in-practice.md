Today’s development process is widely based upon agile methodology. Implementation of feature flags is listed as one of DevOps best practices. Approaches to testing have changed a lot lately and only few dev teams are lucky enough to have dedicated tester/QA. Automated tests are good, but you cannot automate everything. Bugs are still existing, and testers must prioritise wisely. That’s why I think that progressive delivery with feature flags helps us on daily basis to work more efficient and to have control over our deliveries.

I would like to share how my team develops new features, tests them, and deliver them to production. 

By working this way, we are: 
•	Delivering features more rapidly 
•	Having the flexibility to open features for specific segments 
•	Reducing the number of bugs in production 
•	Increasing customer satisfaction with increased delivery frequency 
•	Reducing fear of change and stress related to deploying software 
•	Responding quicker to changes
