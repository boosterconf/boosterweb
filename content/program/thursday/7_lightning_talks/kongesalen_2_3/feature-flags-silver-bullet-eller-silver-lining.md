"Can't we just launch it behind a feature flag?" – a phrase often heard in agile software development. These flags are often a dream for project managers but can turn into a nightmare for developers to implement. Is it really as simple as "just launching on a Friday afternoon" without any worries? What is the actual difference between a release toggle, kill switch, and an A/B testing flag? When is it wise to use feature flags, and when should we avoid them? How can we keep our code clean and prevent it from turning into a tangled mess of spaghetti? We will also explore some of the exciting tools available out there. And last but not least, share our own experiences – both the good and the not-so-good – from Vibbo and Styrerommet apps that we are working on for OBOS.
