The Ouvroir de littérature potentielle (Workshop of potential literature) movement, founded in the 1960s, explored creativity by applying strict constraints to writing. These constraints — like avoiding specific letters or using mathematical structures — forced authors to think differently and produced unique literary works. 

In this lightning talk, we’ll apply the principles of Oulipo to programming. By reimagining familiar programming exercises with unusual rules and restrictions, we’ll explore how constraints can lead to new insights and approaches in coding. This approach, though unconventional, offers valuable lessons in problem-solving and creativity in software development.
