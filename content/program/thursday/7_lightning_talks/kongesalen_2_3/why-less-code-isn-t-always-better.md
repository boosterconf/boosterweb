Have you ever come across a piece of code that's been "optimized" so much that it is impossible to read?
Let’s talk about the fine line between making code efficient and turning it into a cryptic mess. I’ll share some funny examples of code that’s been boiled down to one-liners or clever tricks that look cool... until you try to figure out what they actually do. In this quick talk, we’ll explore why readable code is sometimes better than the "simplified" version, and how to strike a balance between elegance and clarity.
