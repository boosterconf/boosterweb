Great research starts with asking the right questions. But poorly designed ones — whether in surveys, interviews, or usability tests — can result in biased answers and unreliable data, impacting decisions across product, design, and engineering.

This talk explores the psychology behind how people respond to surveys. You’ll walk away with practical techniques to overcome bias and uncover accurate insights.

In this session, you’ll learn how to:
•  Create more effective surveys that deliver reliable results
• Design questions that reduce bias and build trust with respondents 
• Harness the power of sentence completion, a lightweight yet powerful technique that reveals deeper insights beyond standard checkboxes

Packed with examples and actionable tips, this talk will empower UX professionals, designers, and tech teams to ask better questions.
