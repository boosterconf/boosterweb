The Norwegian Labour and Welfare Administration (NAV) is one of Norway’s largest employers and are responsible for upholding the Norwegian welfare state. In this talk I'll share how we used product design methodology to design, deliver and continuously improve a digital application for child benefit in Norway by moving away from a solely paper-based application.

I’ll talk about how we gathered insight, both qualitative from real users and case managers, as well as quantitative through various different platforms. I'll also talk about the potential benefits that come with digitizing a paper-based form, and how we measured the success of our product. At the end I will show our concrete results, and reflect on how we spend the taxpayers money to make better digital services for the inhabitants of Norway.

This session is for designers, product leads and content designers who want to learn about how one of Norway’s largest government agency works to improve its products and services and how digitizing a paper form opens doors to gathering data in a smarter and more efficient ways, as well as how to use quantitative measures both to evaluate the success of your product, and as a tool to help prioritizing and improving your design.
