The past year we have seen massive advancements in AI image generation, where they can generate almost any conceivable concept. At this point, they are so widespread that everyone can try it with just a few clicks, but are these AIs just a means of entertainment, or can they be of practical use?

In this presentation we attempt to answer this by sharing our experience with creating a point and click game using nothing but AI generated art. Along the way we learned a lot, and if we knew then what we know now, it would have gone a lot smoother. To help you avoid the mistakes we made, we explore some of the tips and tricks we discovered and share our take on the future of AI art in software development.
