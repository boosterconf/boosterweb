Retrospectives are supposed to help our teams continuously improve. But where do we turn when our retros continuously fall flat? The same issues come up over and over, but your team canâ€™t seem to get traction on them. When you feel like youâ€™re living the dev team version of Groundhog Dayâ€¦ it's time to rescue those retros.
In this workshop, youâ€™ll take part in a variety of exercises aimed at helping you figure out how to guide a team out of its retro rut. Youâ€™ll learn about the foundations of effective retrospectives: those non-negotiable elements that must be in place for retros to succeed. And drawing from design thinking principles and W. Edwards Demingâ€™s work on the science of improvement, weâ€™ll help you identify what to start, stop, and continue doing to get your teamâ€™s retros back on track.

Note: If youâ€™re on a team that has (or needs!) retros, this workshop is designed for you â€“ regardless of whether youâ€™re a facilitator.
