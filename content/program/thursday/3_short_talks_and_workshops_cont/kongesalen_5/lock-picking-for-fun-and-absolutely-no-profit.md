Have you ever wondered how the lock on your front door actually works? This workshop offers a hands-on introduction to the inner workings of common locks. We’ll explore how pins, tumblers, and other mechanisms interact, and then move from theory to practice as participants try their hand at opening a number of padlocks on their own.

The focus of this workshop is on learning, curiosity, and a deeper appreciation of everyday objects we take for granted. By the end of the session, you’ll understand what makes locks tick, where their strengths and weaknesses lie, and why design details matter. All participants will be provided with a training lock and a set of lock picking tools to continue exploring on their own after the workshop.

We will end the session with a fun contest where the best lock picker can win a prize!

Disclaimer: This workshop is intended purely for fun and exploration; the skills demonstrated are for educational use only and must never be applied to any illegal activity.

Takeaways:
	•	A practical understanding of how common locks function.
	•	Hands-on experience with training locks.
	•	A kit to take home for continued exploration.
