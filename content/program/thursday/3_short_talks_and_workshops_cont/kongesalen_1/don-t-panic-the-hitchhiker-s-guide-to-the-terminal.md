Once upon a time the terminal was the primary way to engage with computers. In our time graphical user interfaces reign supreme and many people can get by perfectly fine without ever using the terminal. And yet, there may come a time when you will have to use it. And I am aiming to prepare you for these times.
What is the difference between a terminal and a shell? How do you navigate your files from the terminal? These questions and many more shall be answered in this hands-on exploration of the terminal.
If you are curious about or intimidated by the terminal, this is the workshop for you.
