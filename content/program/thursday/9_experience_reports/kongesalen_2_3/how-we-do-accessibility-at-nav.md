Providing everyone equal access to welfare services through NAV is not only legally mandated, but it is fundamental to NAV's mission. A big part of that is making sure our web services are accessible and easy to use. With 80 cross-functional product teams, this work needs to scale well.

In this talk I will explain how we work with accessibility at NAV through our design system and accessibility teams. We will talk about testing, training, sharing and culture building. And hopefully you will learn something you can bring back to your own organisation.
