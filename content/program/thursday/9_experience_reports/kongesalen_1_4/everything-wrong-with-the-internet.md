Ever wondered how childhood road trips could make you better at creating digital solutions? Or why taking the subway in Oslo feels more exhausting than ever? Are accessibility requirements really at the root of everything wrong with the internet? And how can a simple melody turn a confusing user journey into a fantastic one?
