What happens when you take design lessons from car dashboards and try to steer a ferry toward lower emissions? This talk dives into how familiar eco-feedback principles from driving don’t always sail smoothly into maritime contexts, and what we learn when they don’t. Discover how small contextual shifts can completely change design assumptions, and why crossing domains can spark both creativity and caution. A short story about designing for sustainability, learning from other industries, and knowing when to stop following the map and start reading the sea.
