When testing together with other organisations one of the challenges is sharing test data. This has become more complex as the privacy rules have become strickter. We can't share data from production copies any longer, and when everyone can create their own test data the chances that they are coordinated across different organisations will go down.
I will show how we do this at Nav when testing with other government agencies and private companies. I will give an overview of resources that are available and also show one or two examples of what we have done.
Even though Nav is a large organisation with plenty of resources this can fairly easily be replicated in smaller organisations.
