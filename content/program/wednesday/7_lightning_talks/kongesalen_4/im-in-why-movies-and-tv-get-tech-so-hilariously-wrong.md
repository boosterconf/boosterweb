We all love a good movie or TV show, but almost every time technology is involved, something ridiculous happens.
The hacker cracks government security in 30 seconds, the CCTV cameras zoom in to read license plates and someone types furiously at a keyboard until a satellite is compromised.
Why do writers keep getting the most basic of tech so wrong?

Join me as we dive into some infamous tech tropes from film and television and ask the question: "What if these scenes aren’t just a result of bad writing? What if they reflect a deeper truth: that explaining real-world tech is just really hard?"

If you’ve ever screamed at the screen "That’s not how that works!" then this talk is for you!
