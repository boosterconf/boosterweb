BFF, or Backend For Frontend, is a pattern designed to abstract away details from the frontend, by implementing them in a backend. When you are making an application that authenticates the user through OAuth flows and OpenID Connect, this pattern allows you to make the client a more secure confidential client, instead of a less secure public client.

In this talk I will explain what problems this pattern addresses, when you can use it, and why you should become BFF's with your authentication flows.
