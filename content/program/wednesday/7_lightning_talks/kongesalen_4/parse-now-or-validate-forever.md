"Wait, haven't I already done that?"

Unless you're a compiler, whether a particular value has and hasn't been validated isn't always obvious. Do you verify that the value has been validated somewhere else, or would you rather double-check for some extra peace of mind? Neither of these options are particularly appealing, so what can we do instead? By putting the type system to work, we can become certain that a value has been validated where we need it. Boost your confidence in your code with *parsing*: Structure your inputs at the very edge of your API, and say farewell to endless validation.
