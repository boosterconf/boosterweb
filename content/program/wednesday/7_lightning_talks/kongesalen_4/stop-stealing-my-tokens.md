You’ve probably heard of OAuth. Maybe you’re even using it. Then you’re most likely also using Bearer Tokens. Which are great and all. Well, until someone steals them!

This talk gives a short and fun introduction to DPoP, or Demonstrating Proof of Possession, an extension to OAuth that allows one to cryptographically bind access tokens to a particular client when they are issued, hence making them harder to steal.
