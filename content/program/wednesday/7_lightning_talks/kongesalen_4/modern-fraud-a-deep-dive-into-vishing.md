We have all gotten a random phone call from Microsoft support, coming from a foreign number. Most of us understand that this is a scam and do not pick up the phone, or just immediately hang up. So why do they keep coming? 

In this lightning talk we will dive into an up and coming fraud strategy, that unfortunately yields unexpectedly high returns, Vishing. 
We will go through an introduction to vishing, how to properly execute it. And how the  police, banks, and telecom operators actively work against it.
