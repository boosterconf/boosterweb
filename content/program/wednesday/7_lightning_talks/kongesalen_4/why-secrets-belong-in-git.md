Encrypted secrets that is! The audience will learn about tools and techniques that will enable them to version control secrets alongside the code these secrets belong to. Easily share secrets with new team members and get a full audit log as a bonus. All while following modern security practices.

The session will introduce SOPS and how attendees can use keys stored in secure remote services like Azure Key Vault or HashiCorp Vault to encrypt and decrypt files. Access is easily controlled through the same identity providers they use for other services. The presentation will cover some gotchas to be aware of, but there's no need to be afraid of putting secrets in Git!
