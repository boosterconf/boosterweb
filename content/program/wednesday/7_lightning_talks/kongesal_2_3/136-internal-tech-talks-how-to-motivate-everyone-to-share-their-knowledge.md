Going to conferences is great, but when your organization reaches a certain size, there is a huge untapped potential when it comes to doing internal knowledge sharing too. Your organization has skilled programmers, UX experts, test experts ++. And when "nudged" in the correct way, they all have lots to share. I want to talk about how we approach this in our organization. First, you need to create ownership to these sessions. Someone, or everyone, has to have a responsibility. Second, the different formats. From "good ol' slideshows", to panel debates to live coding sessions to workshops. Some ideas worked and some did not.
