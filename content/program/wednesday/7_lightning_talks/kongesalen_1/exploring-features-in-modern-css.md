How often do you take the time to read about all the cool new stuff that's been added to CSS in the last few years? I did exactly that, so you don't have to, and I want to share the awesome features I found with you!

Did you know that changing the styling of an element based on the width of its parent is actually really easy? And how about custom colors for native input elements or a powerful way to organize selector specificity? It's all just a few lines of CSS away!

Join me in this lightning talk as we take a quick look at 7 CSS features that range from relatively new to cutting edge. We of course also cover how these can be used in practice without throwing older browsers to the wolves.
