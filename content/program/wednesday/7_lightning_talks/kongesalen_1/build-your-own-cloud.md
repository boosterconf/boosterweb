In light of todays weakened trust in the "tech giants" and the focus on privacy and security, we will explore an alternative to the "spin it up in {Insert cloud provider here}" solution. In this talk, we will take a look at various open source tools and software that can be used to build a competitive hosting platform. Do we have to give up the advantages that the hyperscalers provide? Are there specific benefits to building it yourself? Is this only relevant for large companies with their own DevOps teams? These are questions we will explore in this session.
