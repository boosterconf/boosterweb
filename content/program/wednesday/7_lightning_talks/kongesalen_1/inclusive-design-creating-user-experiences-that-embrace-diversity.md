This talk explores inclusive designâ€”a human-centered approach that goes beyond accessibility and universal design to create experiences that embrace the full diversity of human characteristics. Through real-world examples, it highlights the importance of designing for differences in ethnicity, gender, age, physical abilities, and socio-economic backgrounds, ensuring that digital and physical products foster inclusion and belonging for all.
