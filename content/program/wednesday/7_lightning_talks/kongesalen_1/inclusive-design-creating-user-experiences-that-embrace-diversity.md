The talk explores the concept of inclusive design, a design approach that goes beyond traditional accessibility and universal design to create products, interfaces, and experiences that consider the full diversity of human characteristics. It highlights the importance of recognizing and accommodating differences in ethnicity, gender, age, physical abilities, and socio-economic backgrounds to ensure that everyone can benefit from and enjoy digital and physical products.
