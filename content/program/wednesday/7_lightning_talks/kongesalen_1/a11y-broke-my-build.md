Accessibility is often an afterthought, something done manual and late in the development cycle. But I made accessibility break my build and now I will help you break yours! Time to shift accessibility left, add automatic testing that can run in all development steps, catch errors and make the feedback loop as short as possible.

This is not your average dry accessibility talk with long WCAG check lists, but will use lots of humor to try to get the audience to follow along and get the value out of using accessibility tooling.
