"Can't you just sketch something quickly?" Is a question that all UX-designers have gotten at least once in their career. Most will experience a mildly frustrated answer in return. Why is that? Why can't we UX-designers "just sketch something quick"? In this talk, I want to give a introduction to what UX-design really is, how we make our choices and a brief talk on the principles those choices are built on. And most important of all; how User Experience design differentiates from User Interface design.
