Unpacking the Illusion of Teamwork in Agile Development.

Many software teams claim to be “Agile,” but in reality, they operate as loosely connected individuals rather than cohesive, high-performing teams. In this talk, we’ll explore the illusion of teamwork—how daily standups, ticket ownership, and even Agile rituals can mask siloed behavior and developer ego. Drawing from real-world examples and Agile principles, we’ll contrast dysfunctional patterns with the traits of truly collaborative teams. You’ll leave with practical strategies to foster trust, shared ownership, and team-level accountability—whether you’re a developer, Scrum Master, or leader.
