After years working in PR, IT Operations, and DevOps, and spending time as a Scrum Master along the way, I’ve learned that uptime isn’t everything, especially when it comes to humans. When I started my software engineering studies at 30, I thought the key to catching up was spending more hours in front of the screen. It wasn’t.
I discovered that my most creative ideas often appeared when I stepped away from the keyboard. In this lightning talk, I’ll show how taking breaks can boost creativity, sharpen focus, and bring clarity to complex problems in the fast-paced day-to-day of a developer. You’ll leave with a few simple, evidence-based habits for building rest into your schedule, because time spent off the screen isn’t lost – it is maintenance.
