You are passionately enthusiastic about code and proud of the good quality you deliver in every pull request. You are also a curious soul who thrives deep down in the rabbit hole of your hobby. All hobbies cost time. Most cost money. Some cost a lot of money, but you are smart. You find a way to make money from your hobby. You need an online store. You can write the code and pay in the time spent, but how much time do you really want to pay?

This is something Christian has pondered a lot over the last 4 years since he started a coffee roastery in his garage. The hobby wasn't supposed to become a part-time job, it was just supposed to be fun. And what's more fun than cutting corners, taking shortcuts, and defining for yourself what is good enough?

In this lightning talk, Christian will talk about the experiences he has gained from his quest to become Bergen's most caffeine-obsessed developer, and how he has gained more empathy for product owners along the way.
