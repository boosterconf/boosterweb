This practice is something we stumbled upon, inspired by journaling, personal knowledge management (aka PKM) and Llewellyn Falco's very efficient "observation retrospectives". We tried this in a team and it had some interesting effects. Then we tried it in some more settings and people enjoyed it. Now we just have to share it with the Booster attendees!
