In the winter of 2022 I went on maternity leave. Little did I know what awaited me six months later when I tried to get back into the swing of things.

I had once been a go-to person in my team, confidently making architectural decisions. Now, I found myself repeatedly asking the same questions about Spring Boot.

This is my story of how it felt like going back to work, with a brain that was suddenly failing me, and the way back towards normal.

Spoiler alert; Being surrounded by great people helps. Sleep is nice on occasion too.
