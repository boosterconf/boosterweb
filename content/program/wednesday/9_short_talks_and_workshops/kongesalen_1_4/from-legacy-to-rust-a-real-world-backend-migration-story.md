Rust is the most admired programming language.
But is it production ready? 
And is it possible to hire developers?
Can you convince management to use it?

This talk will cover our story at Zrch, where we use Rust as the main language in our backend. We will share our learnings, our migration approach and the challenges we overcame along the way.

What you'll learn:
• How our first attempt to rewrite legacy code failed (and why)
• The strategies that made our Rust migration successful
• Pain points of Rust
• Interactions with other languages
• Building a Rust team: hiring  and onboarding challenges
• Leveraging AI tools for Rust development
• If time permits, we will briefly cover frontend aspects

Whether you're evaluating a new language (like Rust) for your next project or already committed to the journey, this session offers practical insights from a team that's been there.
