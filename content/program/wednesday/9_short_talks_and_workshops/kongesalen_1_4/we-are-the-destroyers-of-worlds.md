This is an experience report on what I have learned since starting to look at how software is used as a weapon.

The talk will look at how software is destroying our worlds and every living being on it? 
How are we as developers to deal with this, when we are so used to see ourselves as the saviors? 
Is there something about our self image that needs to change? 

A heads up: 
This talk mentions things such as genocide, destruction of all life and human suffering.
