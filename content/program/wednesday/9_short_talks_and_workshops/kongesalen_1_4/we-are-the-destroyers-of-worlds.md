Starting with looking at the origins of software development this talk follows looks at its application up until the current times.

The talk will look at how software is destroying our worlds and every living being on it? 
How are we as developers to deal with this, when we are so used to see ourselves as the saviors? 
Is there something about our self image that needs to change?
How can we combat and stop destroying our foundations for living? How can we stop killing innocent lives all over this planet because of requirements by our industry?
