In this talk, I will share the story of not just keeping the project afloat, but also maintaining high delivery standards, team spirit, and one's peace of mind along the way. Weâ€™ll explore some hands-on strategies for using Agile practices with a touch of psychology to keep the sails up during agile transformation amidst crisis, even when the winds are unpredictable.
