If you’re using microservices on Kubernetes and want to improve the developer experience for your local setup, you should attend this talk.

In this talk, I’ll cover how you can use Tilt to spin up and work with multiple microservices - all in your local environment. With Telepresence, you can connect to dependent services running on dev/staging environments - during your local development process.

This talk is NOT just tool-focused. Although I’ll cover these tools and how they can work well together, my goal is to help you understand how to improve your local development workflow. 

Here are some day-to-day development workflow-related use cases that I’ll cover in the talk

Pull request-based preview environments to deploy into ephemeral namespaces. 
Develop and debug services, with dependent services deployed on remote Kubernetes environments.
Make integration easier by allowing you to hot-reload code where you can see all your changes to code during development
