We are four moms wanting to make an app to organize our family life in a better way than we are doing now. None of the apps on the market right now fit our needs, so we are creating our own. We are a team consisting of one developer, one designer, one doctor and one influencer. By march 2023 hopefully a lot has happened. This will be the story of how it went so far.
