NATS is a high-performance, open-source messaging system designed for real-time distributed communication, similar to Kafka but lightweight and easy to use. This interactive workshop offers a deep dive into the core capabilities of this technology. Participants will engage with real-time messaging through a live chatroom to experience NATS' pub-sub architecture firsthand using the CLI. From there, they'll collect data from a public API and send it to a NATS JetStream, showcasing persistent data handling. Using key-value buckets, attendees will preserve the state of this data and ultimately use NATS request-reply pattern to create an API in order to retrieve the data. This session not only provides a hands-on exploration of NATS but also demonstrates how it can be applied to real-world data streaming and API creation scenarios, making it an ideal fit for a technically engaged audience. NATS provides client libraries in various programming languages, making the session flexible and accessible.
 
The workshop hosts are Anders & Morten, who both are developers at Eviny Fornybar in Bergen. At Eviny we use NATS as the core of our data flows, providing our end users with fast and reliable access to data.
