In this workshop we will explore the power of LEGO® SERIOUS PLAY® a facilitation method which stimulates play, fun and creativity by using LEGO® bricks. We will experience surprising results when thinking with our hands. 

LEGO® SERIOUS PLAY® can be used for a broad range of topics - e.g. problem solving, strategy creation and teambuilding. 

Come join me for a different and energizing workshop - forget the post-it notes, we will only use LEGO® bricks so bring your inner child along! :-)
