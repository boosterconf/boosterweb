Automatic accessibility tests will help us build better, more inclusive applications today and help us ensure that our applications continue to be accessible in the future.

In this workshop you'll learn how to set up and write your own automatic accessibility tests using Axe and Playwright. We'll cover how to set up the tests and will look at what we can find with different types of tests. While doing this we'll also cover some of the most common accessibility errors that can be discovered automatically and learn how to fix them.
