The software sector has partly accepted/adapted to the unpredictability of digital product development. But still, there are leaders on different levels in the organization who see this lack of preditability as sort of a teething disease that we will eventually grow out of.

If everyone involved could accept that digital product development is more or less unpredictable regardless of maturity, maybe we could have had better discussions on how to handle this.

Kristin has researched this in her PhD, and together with Anne she has explored ways of explaining the unpredictability – with different results. But we don’t give up!

In this lecture we will present some of our experiences, in trying to explain the inherent unpredictability that digital product development entails.
Our aim is to provide each of you with inspiration and models that may help you change your part of the world. 
So, not amibtious at all....
