We live in a world of change. We are constantly facing new technology, roles and responsibilities are changing and it's easy to feel that you're either falling behind or getting burned out. At conferences we learn lots of new stuff that we would like to try out. At the same time we need to deliver high quality in our regular jobs. How? Demanding that all professional development comes on top of our normal workload or needs to happen in our free time is not sustainable.

I'll give you effective learning strategies and clever tricks for learning at work. This way you can become an asset to the team, your boss will see the advantage of sending you to conferences and you can spend your free time on the stuff that gives you energy.
