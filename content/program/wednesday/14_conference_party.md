After dinner, we stay at USF Verftet with a concert, fun activities and a chill board game zone, all available at the same time in different rooms varying from loud and booming to quiet and talkative! We call it the Booster Party, in partnership with our lovely partners Itera, Webstep, Atea and Sonat. Doors open at 20:00. Bring your conference badge, as this is your ticket.
