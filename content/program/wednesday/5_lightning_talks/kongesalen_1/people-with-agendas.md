Alexander Hamilton wrote a warning in 1787, that looking for peace and harmony among neighbouring states is to disregard the uniform course of human events. 
There is a war in Europe, we are in a still escalating hybrid situation with Russia and we know our code and data can and will be weaponized if the powers that be decide to do so. 
Moreover, big tech are pushing their own agenda, they do not like EU regulations that hit them in the pocket but they do love our money. At the same time they hold incredible power in terms of technology that cannot be easily replaced and enormous amounts of our data that cannot be easily moved. 
What the f ... do we do?
