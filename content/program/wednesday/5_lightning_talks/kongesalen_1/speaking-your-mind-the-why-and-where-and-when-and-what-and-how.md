According to a survey performed by NRK in 2023 36% of people in Norway choose to withhold their opinions because they are afraid of the response.

How can we, as IT professionals, make sure that our spaces are safe to participate in and engage with? How do we make sure that both junior and senior colleagues feel free enough to express their professional opinions, while allowing them to be themselves in the process?

A team where everyone feel comfortable to voice their professional opinions, is a team filled with diverse ideas and thoughts. This allows the team more chances to succeed in their work.

In this session we will look into what speaking your mind means for your team; what forums are appropriate for your opinions; how to recognise when someone is open for your ideas; whether there are any opinions you can keep to yourself; and what considerations to make when you word yourself to your colleague.
