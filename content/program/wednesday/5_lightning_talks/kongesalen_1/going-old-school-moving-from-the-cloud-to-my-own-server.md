How is it like going back to the good old days of early 2000, where anything ran on it's own server?

I will share my experience of moving away from the cloud and back to a virtual private server. What can you get, and what do you lose? What does it mean in terms of deployment processes, security, robustness, scalability, privacy and compliance and performance?

...and the big question of course: Would I do it again?
