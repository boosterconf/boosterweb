This talk will inspire you to use strategic storytelling as a tool to achieve a desired outcome. You will be introduced to a simple model by McKee & Gerace (2018) which you can use to structure your next story in an engaging and convincing way. You will be introduced to heroes, villains, obstacles, and allies and learn how the characters and the plot will create a story that will capture the audience's attention.
