What if you could run your entire frontend project in the browser? Not just the client part, but your server, your build pipeline, and your editor. 

StackBlitz is exactly that. A fully featured development environment running entirely in your browser. It can run backends using Node.js without any downloads or installations, booting fresh development instances in milliseconds. 
It achieves this by leveraging WebContainers: a WebAssembly-based operating system that can run Node, npm and more. Unlike traditional online IDE's, it does not run via a VM backend. It is all happening inside your browser. 

This talk will introduce listeners to the WebContainer technology, and show applications of the technology that is available for you to use on your projects right now.
