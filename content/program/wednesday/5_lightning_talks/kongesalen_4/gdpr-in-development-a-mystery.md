How you ever met a developer who loves GDPR? I don't think I have. Most developers I talk with about GDPR, seems to in best case look at it as something that will slow them down and create months long processes with someone in legal who seems to be talking a different language. 

GDPR has been in place for 5 years, and yet it seems to be a mystery for most developers. In this lightening talk, I will talk about why GDPR is relevant for development teams, what seems to make it hard, and give some tips on how to make it better. 

You might not make you love GDPR just from this lightening talk, but maybe you will be more curious to learn more.
