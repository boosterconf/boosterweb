A few years ago some people at work built a smart mirror for use at a conference. Maybe you've seen it? It had face recognition, personalized content, weather forecast, bus schedule, and so on.

Since there was nothing stopping us, we followed up by building smaller versions to bring home with us, and mine quickly became a popular "member of the family".

Now I will show you how easily you too can build your own smart mirror!
