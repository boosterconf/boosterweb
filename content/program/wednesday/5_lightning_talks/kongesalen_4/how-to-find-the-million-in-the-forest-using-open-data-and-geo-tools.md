In recent years, Horde AS has organized a real treasure hunt - a box hidden somewhere in the Norwegian wilderness, streamed live online. The clues were few, but the camera streamed continuously, and the first person to find and reach the location won the prize worth over one million kroner.

But how do you even begin to narrow down where the box could be - when all you have is a livestream from an unknown location?

Inspired by this, I`ve developed my own tools to help with the search; called FALKE+BLIKK.

In short it`s a "investigation toolkit" for combining open data with automated integration into a GIS (Geographic Information System). Bringing both worlds together in one unified solution.

Welcome down into my rabbit hole. Through some detective work, coding and GIS we`ll take a look at some of my lessons to build a toolbox for a modern day treasure hunt.
