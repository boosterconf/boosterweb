Retrospectives are often associated with work, but what if you could bring this powerful tool home to improve your family life? 
I will share my experience of running family retrospectives and a post-mortem after an unsuccessful attempt to buy a new home. These practices have helped us stay sane and connected, be more open, and continuously improve in a blameless manner. 
I will give tips and tricks on making retros practical and engaging for all ages (4+). Whether you want to improve communication, resolve conflicts, or celebrate your wins together, family retrospectives can be a powerful way to bring your family closer.
By the end of this talk, I hope to inspire you to try these techniques in your personal life and see their positive impact.
