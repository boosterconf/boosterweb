Throughout the years, once in a while, I'd hear people refer to an exercise called "Elephant Carpaccio". And yet I never ran into someone actually facilitating the exercise, allowing me to participate. So I ended up doing the next best thing: I ran it  a few times myself, with some of my colleagues as benevolent participants / test subjects. Also, it was fully remote.

In this lightning talk I'll share why I like "Elephant Carpaccio" so much and how I went about facilitating the exercise without ever having done it myself. And maybe that will inspire you to run some exercises with or for your colleagues yourself!
