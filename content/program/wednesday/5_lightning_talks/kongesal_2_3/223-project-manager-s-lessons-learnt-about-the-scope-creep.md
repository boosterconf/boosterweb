Scope creep is something everyone is aware of and even knows what to do with, but still many fall into this trap.
We all are trying to be agile and welcome changes, even when customer locks the schedule…and cost…and still expects the high quality. Sounds familiar?
I will share my experience from an innovative project I’ve been running for last 2 years and tell how I dealt with the scope creep, and what I learnt from it.
