I am an introvert. And I'm not particularly fond of a lot of attention. But at the same time, I know that if I am to succeed in my career and achieve my goals, I need to be more visible. And I also actually like to share my experiences and ideas. So I push myself to be more on a stage, talking to an audience. 
To compensate for my nervousness and lack of comfort in the spotlight, I make sure to be well prepared. I would like to share with you how I do that. In this experience report I will talk about how I
1. get into a position where I actually get invited to a stage.
2. starts my preparations and how I seek help (and what type of help I am looking for). 
3- handle the extra stress when I'm not going to talk in my mother tongue.

I will also share some tricks I use the days, hours and minutes before walking into the spotlight, so that I increase the probability of a success.
