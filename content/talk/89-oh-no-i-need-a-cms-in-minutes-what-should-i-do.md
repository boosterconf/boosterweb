"CMS" might not be the first thing that comes to mind when you hear "Google Sheets", but maybe it should be! Unlike headless CMSs like Strapi, Ghost and Sanity, a spreadsheet is something "everyone" understands. By choosing Google Sheets, we can utilize this understanding to quickly get started with a flexible and efficient CMS, which even supports collaborative editing. In this lightning talk, I present how you can set up a headless CMS in 10 minutes using Google Sheets, and when you would want to do so (spoiler alert: when you need it in 10 minutes). To sum it up, I explain how this solution is used by TV 2.
