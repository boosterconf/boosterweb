In 2023, the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 will turn five years old. Almost ready for elementary school, even though it was just adopted by Norwegian law two years ago. It is now time to look ahead to WCAG 2.2 and the new requirements that look likely to make the cut this time.

We will have a quick look at the new requirements, and the process remaining before this all applies to us in Norway. And before we finish up, we will also have a look in the divining ball at how WCAG 3.0 might look - a completely revamped specification that will break with a lot of what we know today.
