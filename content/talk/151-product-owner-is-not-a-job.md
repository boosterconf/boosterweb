Every time I see an open position for a Product Owner, I die a little inside. Every time I meet someone who has Product Owner as their job title, I want to give them a hug, and tell them that everything will be okay in the end.

The fact that Product Owner is used as a title shows at best an immature product culture, and at worst a fundamental misunderstanding of modern product development. And it's holding back teams everywhere.

This is an opinion talk, please bring popcorn.
