Join us to experience what interactive development (also known as REPL-driven development) is about! Feel the joy of immediate feedback, growing your program in tiny increments, of restart-less development!

Suitable for anyone who has some experience with programming. Having experience with JavaScript is pretty useful (since a few key things there are similar to Clojure, which we will use).
