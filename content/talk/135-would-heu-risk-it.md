As we gain testing experience and domain expertise, we start making better decisions around risk. However, it’s easy to get stuck in the same patterns and turn a blind eye to other risks and priorities. In short: we risk failing to pay enough attention and overlook critical testing we should have done. The good news is: there are a lot of things  we can use to do better work, grow and help others and there are even a lot of ways of identifying our own weak spots. 
To learn more about these traps, tools and weapons we can use gamification!

In this workshop, you’ll get to try a simulation that combines risk analysis with practical heuristics, and a big dash of fun! Gamifying your classic risk analysis helps us overcome unconscious biases and think laterally as we plan our testing. Playing may also entice non-testers to join the party and learn exploratory testing skills. Tried-and-true techniques combined with a new approach mean better outcomes for our customers!
