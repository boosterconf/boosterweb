Here we are, at a conference. Have you ever wanted to be a speaker listed amongst the others and thought "How on Earth do I even get started?"

In this workshop, we'll prepare talk ideas, craft a bio, get techniques on slides, flow, impostor syndrome, inclusive language and more! Maybe even play a game of Slide Karaoke?

If you want to be a tech speaker, then you can totally do it!
