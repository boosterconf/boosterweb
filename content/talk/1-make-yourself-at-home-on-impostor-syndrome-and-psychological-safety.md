Once upon a time, Maja landed a job at a big digital agency as a developer. An _experienced_ developerâ€”the kind who should know How Things Are Doneâ„¢. ...But she didn't. Uh oh. ðŸ˜±

In this talk, Maja will tell you about impostor syndrome, psychological safety, and (what she takes to be) the relationship between the two, with the goal of showing you what you and your teammates will need to keep impostor syndrome in check and flourish together. ðŸŒº
