In 2014 i held a lightning talk about the Tight Loose Tight model at Smidigkonferansen, a model I had used to train leaders in an agile mindset. 

7 years later the Tight Loose Tight model is gaining traction, being used by companies like Telenor, NAV and Statens Vegvesen. In this speech I will explain the idea behind Tight Loose Tight, how it is used by businesses to accelerate agile transformation, and the latest development in the model from CoWork.
