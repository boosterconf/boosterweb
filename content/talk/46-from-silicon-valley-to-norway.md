I moved to Norway in 2018 and was struck by how much more modern life was here than in San Francisco. To put it simply: most things just work, and that's pretty cool. It's also one important ingredient in what makes Norway a good place to take risks and work on new things. I start the talk with a bit of Silicon Valley history and how it got to be what it is today, and comment a bit on what makes it special and what makes it struggle. I'll share some personal experiences that illustrate some of the differences, and talk about why I think we're well-situated in Norway to be a part of the future of the tech industry.
