"Well I can't draw, so this is not for me" - you might say.
Then I say: "Thats bullcrap! Sketchnoting is not illustration and art. It's about ideas and communication"

Sketchnoting is a great tool for collecting thoughts and takeaways from talks, facilitate meetings or just make sense of all those crazy ideas you have in your head. And my favorite; remembering names of all the exciting and boring new people you interact with.

I this workshop we will cover some easy techniques to get started with sketchnoting. You’ll leave with your own little visual library, tips'n'tricks and confidence in your own drawing skills! All you need to discover your own way to incorporate sketchnoting in your workflow.
