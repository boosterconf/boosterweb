Green computing is always about energy efficient servers, hardware without hazardous materials and other things that appeal to hardware buffs. Cloud computing is great, but what else can us programmers do to help the environment?
Back in 2009, Anders showed us how to be eco-friendly through writing better code and smarter business logic in his lightning talk Green Code.

Thirteen years later, at dawn of the decade where the world needs to deliver on the UN Sustainability Goals, Anders revisits his 2009 presentation to explore the environmental impact of our software and how programmers can contribute to eco-friendliness by writing better code and designing better software.
