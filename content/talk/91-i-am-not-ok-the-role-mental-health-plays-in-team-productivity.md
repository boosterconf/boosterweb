In today's development climate, mental health is more important than ever. Our health and that of our loved ones, closing offices, the lack of consistent feedback loops and uncertainty, all contribute to our ability to lead teams and for our teams to be effective and productive. 

In this session, attendees will leave with an understanding of the role mental health plays in our teams, and with tools and techniques to help our teams and ourselves talk about mental health and work through these challenges to be happy employees.
