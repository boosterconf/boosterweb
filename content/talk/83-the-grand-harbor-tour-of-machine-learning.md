Machine learning is still not seen as the integral part of software development that it actually is. Certain parts of a software system can actually be implemented much better by a trained model than by a classical development. This creates challenges in the implementation, but also in the definition of the roles and in the integration of the different parts. 

On this tour we look less at technical details, but take the conceptual architecture perspective. We will give a broad overview of how machine learning works, how its approach and process is different from classic development and where it might fit in into your project. All topics are sided by interactive and visual exercises that are either done in groups or on a laptop or even tablet or smartphone.Â  We assume no previous knowledge of machine learning, but this workshop is for all levels. More advanced participants can use this workshop for a deeper dive or a more in detail discussion.
