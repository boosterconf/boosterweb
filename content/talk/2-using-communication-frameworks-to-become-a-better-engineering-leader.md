In this lightning talk version I want to inspire you to invest more of your resources in improving your communication skills, which is something we as engineers very often neglect. However, communication is the source of basically all problems we encounter at work, so I gave it a look from a developer's point of view and will show you some techniques that provide a structured approach to better communication.
