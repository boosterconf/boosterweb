Why is it so painful to admit that I do not know how to use github? Why do the developers lock eyes with their hands or keyboards when I try to discuss the need for a service blueprint? Why does the theme change so quickly when the management team try to adress subjects which noone in the group quite knows how to handle? It is all about psychological safety. When psychological safety is lacking, we become more concerned with what others think of us, than the challenge at hand. In this lightning talk, I will explain what psychological safety is and why it can make your performances better.
