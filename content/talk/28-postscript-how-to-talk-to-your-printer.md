PostScript is the language of printers. A lovely little language with powerful 2D graphics capabilities. Used to describe pages of print we will take this stack-based language and create art of our own.
In this Bob Ross inspired workshop we will take you on an adventure and explore the capabilities of this powerful language, creating lasting art along the way
