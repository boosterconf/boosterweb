In the beginning of 2020, the Norwegian Labor and Welfare Administration (NAV) had around 250-300 PDF applications, counting all variations and translations. Maintenance was expensive and tedious, user experience was poor and most urgently, they were not accessible for all - a legal requirement in Norway.

In a year where COVID would affect how we worked and where major development efforts were spent, our small team started a process that will have a major effect on how you and I interact with NAV: By the end of 2022, all applications will be available to be filled out online at nav.no.

In this talk, I will present how we built FyllUt, a form builder that enables us to build advanced, accessible forms, complete with validation, conditional fields, translations and more using drag-and-drop and with full preview while editing.
