Hello Booster!

Every other monday we host a little podcast called Kortslutning. We talk about all the different big and small things that affect our lives as developers. Mostly human things, but sometimes also computer things.

We've wanted to try and bring our little podcast to the stage, and figured Booster would be the perfect place. So here we are, ready to do the first ever Kortslutning Live.

What we aim to achieve with this first Kortslutning Live is to have a few guests on and talk about something they've experienced or are passionate about in relation to our lives as developers, designers, project leads or otherwise engaged in the IT industry. Hopefully we'll also get some fun and interesting questions from the audience.

We don't know yet what the topics will be, but we can promise good vibes, bad puns, and plenty of straw graspy transitions.

We would love to have you (yes, you) on as a guest, so please drop us a line [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc4FZJU0OCHthaHieS2K_KHh6l8WLHOBhbVpNvsLbiWuE5Npg/viewform).

Much love,
Mikael and Stian
