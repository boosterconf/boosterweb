In our field, we talk of ourselves as craftspeople, but there are a lot to lessons to be learned from more traditional craftsmanship. Give your head a break and let your hands do the work in this workshop, where you will learn how to whittle – the art of carving wood with a knife.

Project instructions are given after each coffee break, but the door will be open all day and you are welcome to drop in any time to spend as much or as little time as you want. The space is limited to 10 people at a time.
