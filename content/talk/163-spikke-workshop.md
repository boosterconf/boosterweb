In our field, we fancy ourselves craftsmen and -women, but there's a lot to lessons to be learned from more traditional craftsmanship.

This workshop is of a slightly different flavour, where you will learn how to whittle – the art of carving wood with a knife.

This workshop is limited to 10 attendees at time, but will run for at longer period and participants can come and go.
