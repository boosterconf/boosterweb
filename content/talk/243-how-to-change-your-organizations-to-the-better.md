In this workshop you will learn more about how design can be applied in development of organizations and strategy processes. The landscape for organizations is unpredictable and constantly changing, and traditional strategy processes can make use of design principles to address the need for constant adaptation, to understand new opportunities and innovate. 

Together, we will demystify working with strategy, and you will learn some tricks to take on these challenges by YOUR skills.The workshop starts with a short introduction, before we will do fun and practical exercises by using our newly developed Strategy board game. 

You will get a board game kit from us, and do not need to bring anything of your own.
