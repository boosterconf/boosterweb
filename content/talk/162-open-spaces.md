Open spaces is a open format, where you, the participants of Booster, decide what the agenda will be. Do you have a topic that you want to discuss? An idea you want to get feedback on? An experience you want to share? Put your topic on the Open Spaces Agenda flip-overs next to the ticket booth. 

We will setup small discussion groups in Kongesalen 2 + 3 + 4, there is plenty of room for many discusssions.

Other than that there are very few rules to follow. Just remember that: 

- Whoever comes is the right people
- Whenever it starts is the right time
- Whatever happens is the only thing that could have
- When it’s over, it’s over

And finally, the law of two feet.
