Let's refactor some code! There's only one thing: just like real life, there are constraints. Everyone is handed the same codebase and a different set of rules. Refactor the truly horrific (if small) codebase on your own or in small teams. Towards the end we will compare your solutions and see how the code has evolved. Maybe there's even a prize for the best solution! The focus will be on improving the code, rather than practicing specific refactoring methods. 
This workshop is for developers, and is suited for all experience levels. The codebase is available both in Java and C#, but you don't have to be an expert in either of these languages to contribute. Luckily, there is complete test coverage so you can focus on refactoring and API design.
