Security is an absolute must these days (and of course has been for some time), but the security architects and security engineers are few. 
A solution to this challange is to create a security guild at your organization, and recruit security champions to this guild.  

Is the concept of a security guild new to you, or you just want to hear how this is currently used in TV 2?  
Join me as I give you a quick peak on how TV 2 has increased the security focus among both engineers and the leaders by training explicit security champions.
