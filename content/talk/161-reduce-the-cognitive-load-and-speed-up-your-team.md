How many times have you heard a manager say: “we have to work smarter”, and then leave the rest as an exercise for you? Using one of our team as a case, we will share with you how they took the initiative to improve both their work processes and tools in order to “work smarter” and increase team happiness.

We will talk about bottlenecks and areas for improvement and also how we have measured our deployment process over time.

Today this team have reduced their development time considerably, they have a much better overview of their process and last but not least the developers and testers are much happier.
