Can Darwins finches help us understand the design prosess? 

Siv will refer to the idea of creativity as an evolutionary process, which is determined by generation (i.e., recombination and mutation), selection, and retention of ideas. 
She will evaluate the design thinking process in terms of its capabilities to activate these mechanisms.

Siv is a UX-lead with a master in biology
