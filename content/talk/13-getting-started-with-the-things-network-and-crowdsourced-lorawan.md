# Say hello to The Things Network
It's an open, crowdsourced, and encrypted wireless IoT network that aims to solve the wireless hurdles of limited range, excessive power consumption, and high operational cost using game-changing LoraWAN technology.

In Bergen, the close to thirty gateways spread throughout the city provide wireless coverage in the most densely populated areas. Every day, thousands of data packets are transmitted from the hundreds of sensors deployed in the area. Maybe the next one will be yours?

This workshop will teach you everything you need to get started with The Things Network, LoraWAN, and crowdsourced  IoT. We will provide you with your very own LoRa-ready microcontroller. If you are lucky, you might get the opportunity to take it home with you, too. 

# We will cover

– The Things Network and LoraWAN explained – how it works and how you can use it in your projects (for fun and profit).
– Fair usage and duty cycle limitations. 
– Spreading factors, data rates and bandwidth.
– Different network activation methods and when to use them: Activation by Personalisation (ABP) versus Over The Air Activation (OTAA).
– The Things Network Console: How to register your free account, configure your applications, and set up data forwarding to external endpoints.
– "Hello, world!": Your first and simple The Things Network application.
– Raw data payload decoding and port routing.
– IoT thermometer: Air temperature readings over the air.

# You should have
– Basic to intermediate programming skills.
– Fundamental knowledge about Arduino and microcontrollers.

# What to bring
– A computer with the Arduino IDE installed and working.

# What we will provide
– Arduino MKR WAN 1310 Microcontroller.
– Aerial antenna.
– TMP36 Analogue Temperature Sensor.
– Necessary cables and wires.


Primarily for: Developers, Architects, Security professionals, Product developers, Others

Participant requirements: – A computer with the Arduino IDE installed and working – A phone running a recent version of iOS or Android
