Booster is a software conference for the entire team. That means if you’re a developer, project manager, architect, UX professional, tester or security professional, we have something for you!

Our goal is that you come back from the conference with real knowledge you can use. That’s why interactive, hands-on workshops fill up most of the hours of the conference. We also have lightning talks, a few short talks, a couple of keynotes and open spaces.

We focus on long breaks for networking, provide excellent coffee and good food.

## Practical information for Booster 2022

### Where and when
The conference takes place March 23-25 2022 in Bergen, Norway. The closest airport is [Bergen Flesland Airport (BGO)](https://avinor.no/en/airport/bergen-airport/). To get to the conference from the airport, take the [airport express coach](http://flybussen.no/en).
