Share with us your ideas, valuable experiences and skills – old and new. Don't hesitate. Be a part of Booster 2026 and submit your contribution now! Or by the submission deadline. Whatever floats your boat.

[Submit your proposal here!](https://sessionize.com/booster-conference-2026)

#### Submission deadline: October 15th 2025

## Pick your format!

We accept submissions that fall under one of the following three categories. Read about them below to find out which format works best for your contribution!

If you need help choosing a format, then let us know. We are more than happy to help.

### #1 – Workshops

Workshops are #1 in our hearts. Booster is – and always will be – all about hands-on learning. The sky's the limit when you get to play with something new. Send us your workshops, please.

**Length:** 1.5-3.0 hours  
**Number of participants:** Up to you

### #2 – Lightning talks

Lightning talks are pretty cool too. Each speaker in a lightning session gets precisely 10 min to share an insight, a method, a technology, or what have you. These sessions are strict on time, so don't forget to kill your darlings and rehearse, rehearse, rehearse!

**Talk length:** 10 min  
**Session length:** 3\*10 min = 30 min

### #3 – Experience Report

Share your story with us. Stories are such an important way to learn from the experience of others. Tell us about how you, created, tested, experienced or did something – alone or with a team. As our program contains fewer experience reports than lightning talks, we expect a high quality of proposals.

**Length:** 30 min  

What should your topic be?
--------------------------

Good question.

In terms of professional content, we are interested in any and all things related to the design, making and managing of software. We don't have topical constraints, which is both a blessing and a curse. However, if you feel it is more like a curse, then here is a tip..

We in the committee would love to read proposals focused on how we as professionals can have a positive impact on our communities. If you have an idea like that, then send it to us.

Got something else in mind? Go for it. We are interested in building a program that reflects what the Booster community cares about.

##### Still need a list?

*   General programming
*   Testing
*   Process and leadership
*   Front-end development
*   UX <3
*   Entrepreneurship
*   Security
*   Architecture
*   Devops
*   Back-end development
*   Fun stuff: Built a robot? Made a language? Pet projects that are just plain weird, interesting or enjoyable.
*   Anything else: IoT, torrenting, coding in schools

As long as your topic is sort of related to software we're interested. Don't fret. Just submit and let us decide!

Speakers benefits
-----------------

*   **A forum** where you can present and discuss your ideas with other smart people.
*   **A free ticket** to the conference!
*   Admission to the **speaker's dinner** on Thursday evening.
*   **Glory**, which may or may not be eternal

### Travel and Accommodations

If financial concerns make it difficult for you to attend as a speaker, then you should apply for reimbursement of travel and/or accommodation expenses.

Do so by filling out the information when submitting your proposal. Our [Monetary policy]({{< relref "info/monetary-policy/" >}}) has all the details.
