Booster is an international IT conference situated in Bergen, and the most important meeting place for the local software development community. Booster is a forum for presentation, debate and study of information technology and agile methods, organized as a three day conference with lectures, workshops and lightning talks of high academic quality.

Booster is aimed at software developers, project managers, testers, designers, architects, security experts and usability professionals. Booster focuses on craftsmanship, methods and quality and facilitates for professional networking.

In order to organize the event we need to raise money from partners. Partners are recognized and acknowledged at the conference with the following benefits:

* Our gratitude and heartfelt thanks, expressed through social media
* Logo on the conference website
* Have a roll-up banner in the plenary room
* Use the Booster Conference's logo in their marketing
* Two tickets to the conference and conference dinner
* One single day ticket (includes conference dinner)
* Early access to registration for Booster Kids (limited tickets available)


To limit the environmental footprint of the conference we have decided not to hand out tote bags with marketing material this year. We are open to suggestions on how to promote your company during the conference.
  
The partnership package price is NOK 35 000,- plus VAT.
