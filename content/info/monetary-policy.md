Booster is a non-profit conference, run by a group of volunteers. Our goal is to create the best possible conference
for our participants and speakers, and to strengthen the local software development community.
Any profits from the conference are used to ensure that we can continue organizing the conference in the following
years. We are normally not able to cover travel and accommodation for speakers.

There are quite a few exceptions though. We invite a limited number of speakers in order to ensure diversity,
and to help market the conference for both submissions and early bird ticket sales. For invited speakers, we refund
reasonable travel expenses and up to 3 nights at the conference hotel. We do not pay honorariums for any speakers.

Many speakers are backed by a company that is able to pay for travel and accommodation, but we do realize that this is not
the case for everyone. If your company is unable to cover these costs, you may apply for reimbursement.

### The following guidelines apply  

In order to be eligble for reimbursement, you must send us an application up front, detailing what you would like us to cover. Send an email to [kontakt@boosterconf.no](mailto:kontakt@boosterconf.no). 

* We can cover reasonable travel costs, and up to 3 nights at the conference hotel.
* We consider each application individually.
* For speakers from Norway, we normally expect your employer to cover your costs. If they won't (or you're independent), please tell us.
* Please send us your reimbursement application after your talk is accepted.
