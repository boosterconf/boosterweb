      <description>&lt;p&gt;In modern software development, with short sprints or even continuous deployment of code, time for manual testing can often be scarce. If we want to properly test for accessibility, we need to make every effort to automate what can be automated, so we can spend our time where it is most valuable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;By attending this workshop, you will get hands-on experience with different tools to test for accessibility. We will cover linting, unit testing and ui-/integration testing using Eslint, React Testing Library, Cypress and Axe. You will also learn about which types of tests you can&amp;rsquo;t automate, and be introduced to some tools to aid your manual testing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
