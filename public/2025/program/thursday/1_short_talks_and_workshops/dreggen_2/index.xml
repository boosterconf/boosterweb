      <description>&lt;p&gt;Drop in, to learn and play. For instructions join us at 9.00am, 10.50, 13.10 or 15.00 on Thursday!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As children we all had to learn how to express ourselves with paint, and paper. Rediscover the joy of painting with this session. No matter if you are an emerging hobbyist or more experienced artist, perhaps you just want to try out forgotten skills, or just want to disconnect for a moment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
