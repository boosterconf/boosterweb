      <description>&lt;p&gt;The reality of domestic violence doesn’t disappear when people enter the digital world. Abusers use technology to exploit and control their victims, meaning that technologists have a responsibility to ensure that users of our products are empowered to protect their safety.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;How can we prevent people with violent intentions from forms of abuse and control that are digital, such as exploiting online banking software to control a partners finances or tormenting them with smart home devices? How can we recognize points of possible intervention where we might be able to help a user who is experiencing domestic violence? How can we make it harder for stalkers to find their victims?&#xA;There are no silver bullets, but thoughtful considerations and small changes while designing and building products can result in meaningful contributions to people’s safety.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
