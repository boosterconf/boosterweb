      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you’re using microservices on Kubernetes and want to improve the developer experience for your local setup, you should attend this talk.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I’ll cover how you can use Tilt to spin up and work with multiple microservices - all in your local environment. With Telepresence, you can connect to dependent services running on dev/staging environments - during your local development process.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This talk is NOT just tool-focused. Although I’ll cover these tools and how they can work well together, my goal is to help you understand how to improve your local development workflow.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
